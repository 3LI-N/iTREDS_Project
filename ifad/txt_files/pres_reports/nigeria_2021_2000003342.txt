Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in 
paragraph 57. 
I.  Context 
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
National context 
1.  With a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria is the most populous country 
in Africa and the largest economy of the region. Like other middle-income 
countries, the country faces significant poverty and inequality challenges. Nigeria is 
home to the largest number of poor in the world, and over 50 per cent of country’s 
poor live in rural areas. The majority of rural poor are women. Of the Nigerian 
farming population, 70 per cent are poor smallholders with limited ability to cope 
with shocks particularly related to climate change; 44.1 per cent suffer from food 
insecurity; 12.6 per cent are undernourished; and 37 per cent of children under 5 
years of age are stunted.1 To feed its growing population, Nigeria has reached a 
critical level of food importation, spending over US$6 billion a year on agricultural 
imports.2 Disruption of farming activities and disturbances in the food supply 
caused by COVID-19 are increasingly threatening the lives of about 100 million 
rural Nigerians and have contributed to perpetuating poverty. 
The key priority of Nigeria’s Medium-Term National Development Plan 2021-2025 is 
agricultural transformation to eliminate poverty, spur job creation and achieve food 
security. In addition, the National Agricultural Technology and Innovation Plan 
(NATIP) 2021-2025 guides Nigeria’s post-COVID-19 economic recovery.  
Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
In line with Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD's Resources (IFAD11) mainstreaming 
commitments, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZ) programme is: 
☒ Youth-sensitive 
☒ Nutrition-sensitive 
☒ Including climate finance 
Youth. The programme will provide youth with opportunities to engage in 
commercially oriented value chains, increase their skills base, improve their 
incomes and, in so doing, enable them to acquire assets. Youth (people aged  
18-29)3 will make up 40 per cent of the direct beneficiaries.  
Food security and nutrition. In Nigeria, 44.1 per cent of the population suffer 
from food insecurity and 12.6 per cent are undernourished.4 Leveraging the key 
role played by women within the food system, the programme will implement 
nutrition interventions that build on increases in incomes and empowerment of 
women.  
Climate. The programme will enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers to 
climate change, supporting the adoption of climate change adaptation and 
mitigation solutions, including through access to green agricultural investments 
facilitated through the Inclusive Green Financing for Low Emission and Climate 
Resilient Agriculture (IGREENFIN) Programme.

programme will leverage the women-focused land development model and 
matching grant scheme developed under the Value Chain Development Programme 
(VCDP) to enhance their access to land and inputs and increase their participation 
in decision-making.  
8. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
The Federal Government of Nigeria requested the support of the African 
Development Bank (AfDB), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and IFAD to set up 
inclusive special agro-industrial processing zones (SAPZs) in the country. AfDB and 
IsDB will support the Government in setting up enabling fiscal policies, incentives, 
and infrastructure for private sector engagement in the zones. IFAD will leverage 
its know-how to help Nigerian smallholders and small operators, youth and women 
to take advantage of the SAPZ market outlets and overcome key challenges such 
as low marketing capacity, poor yields, limited value addition and deficits in access 
to infrastructure, inputs and financial backing.  
B.  Lessons learned 
9. 
The SAPZ programme will leverage best practices and lessons learned from IFAD’s 
experience in Nigeria and elsewhere, as well as key lessons learned relating to 
SAPZs.

The VCDP has shown that linking farmers, ahead of production, to 
guaranteed private off-takers is mutually beneficial as smallholders secure 
profitable outlets for the sale of their produce while off-takers secure a supply 
of produce in the required quantity and quality. 
IFAD-supported commodity alliance forums provide public-private-producer 
networks at the local level where farmers, local authorities and private off-
takers meet on equal footing to negotiate quantities and quality standards, 
competitive prices and means of production, and to manage/prevent 
conflicts.  
Private sector extension service providers through farmer field schools have 
proved instrumental in enhancing smallholder productivity and production in 
the IFAD country programme.  
Evidence shows that special economic zones must be built on strong demand 
from the business sector, and there is a need for a solid legal, regulatory and 
institutional framework.5 This is the foundation of the proposed programme.  
The experience with IFAD-supported agripreneur schemes and the youth 
business incubator model in Nigeria has shown that youth engagement in 
agribusiness is driven by their interest in private enterprises rather than 
group enterprises.  
Concessional resources for green finance support smallholders/small 
operators in starting up climate-resilient agribusinesses, as demonstrated by 
the IGREENFIN experience in Niger, which is stimulating a shift in the 
country’s financial system.  
The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system of the proposed programme 
should leverage IFAD’s impact assessment methodology, and allocate 
adequate budget for capacity-building, leveraging the PRiME training.6 
Nigeria’s context requires adapted country programme management 
modalities, including: (i) a country programme advisory team funded from 
loan proceeds to provide implementation support; (ii) a financial

results in rural development projects. PRiME is a joint initiative developed and implemented by IFAD and the Centers for 
Learning on Evaluation and Results.

management expert providing oversight to projects on compliance with 
financial requirements; and (iii) a procurement expert to strengthen the 
review of procurement no-objection requests from the borrower.  
II.  Programme description 
A.  Objectives, geographical area of intervention and target 
groups 
10.  The overall objectives of the programme are twofold: 
-  Supporting the development of SAPZs in high food production areas to supply 
the domestic food market and create exportable surpluses (AfDB-led); 
-  Empowering smallholders and small operators, including women and youth, to 
take advantage of the markets created by the SAPZs to sustainably enhance 
their income and access to employment, household food security and nutrition, 
and resilience to climate change (IFAD-led).  
11.  Implementation period. The SAPZ programme will follow a two-phased 
programme approach. Under phase I (2022-2028), the Government and AfDB, 
over a period of 5 years, will set up enabling infrastructure and investment policies 
in targeted states. IFAD will operate over a period of seven years. This slightly 
longer period will allow IFAD to empower smallholders to take advantage of the 
SAPZs when they are fully operational. The programme will be expanded into 
additional states in subsequent phases, based on lessons learned and availability of 
funding.  
12.  Programme area. In phase I, the programme will support the set-up of SAPZs in 
the Federal Capital Territory and seven states, namely Kano, Kaduna, Oyo, Kwara, 
Ogun, Imo and Cross River. IFAD will focus on Kano and Ogun states, leveraging 
its ongoing programmes.  
13.  Value chains. Through a participatory selection process involving local authorities 
and communities at start-up, each participating local government area will select 
two focus commodities from among high-potential value chains that have been 
pre-identified in site-specific feasibility studies conducted during appraisal: 
cassava, rice, poultry and fisheries for Ogun state – and rice, tomatoes, 
groundnuts and sesame for Kano state. 
14.  Target groups. Phase I will directly benefit 1.5 million households, including 
private sector agribusinesses and agro-processors, smallholder farmers, 
agroentrepreneurs and agro-dealers. IFAD investments, including through the 
Green Climate Fund (GCF), will target a total of 100,000 direct beneficiaries (and 
500,000 indirect beneficiaries).7 Rural women and youth are core target groups. 
Opportunities for participation will be created for internally displaced persons and 
persons with disabilities. 
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
15.  The programme will have three operational components: (i) infrastructure 
development and management for agro-industrial hubs; (ii) agricultural 
productivity, production, market linkages and value addition in SAPZ catchment 
areas; (iii) policy and institutional development support. 
Component 1: Infrastructure development and management for agro-
industrial hubs 
16.  AfDB and IsDB will support the Government in setting up SAPZs in selected high-
potential areas/states. Each SAPZ will comprise an agricultural industrial hub (AIH) 
and agricultural transformation centre (ATCs), strategically located within the 
production area to aggregate products from the community, transfer them to AIHs 
7 Calculated on the assumption that a beneficiary household has five members.

EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
for value addition and supply centres for distribution and retail to consumers. This 
AfDB and IsDB-led component is fully developed in their respective programme 
appraisal reports. 
Component 2: Agricultural productivity, production, market linkages and 
value addition in SAPZ catchment areas 
17. 
IFAD will lead this component, which has three objectives: (i) support smallholder 
farmers and small operators in increasing their productivity/production and 
capacity to add value to raw materials on a profitable and environmentally 
sustainable basis; (ii) link smallholder farmers and small operators to the additional 
market outlets offered by the SAPZs, and to small processors/traders supplying the 
local markets; and (iii) enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of 
smallholders to climate change. Activities will be organized around three 
subcomponents: agricultural market linkages and value addition; smallholder 
productivity/production enhancement; and access to finance and financial 
inclusion, including access to green agricultural investments facilitated through 
IGREENFIN. 
Component 3: Policy and institutional development support 
18.  AfDB and IsDB will support the Government and target states in setting up 
enabling policies, legislation and regulation for SAPZs to create a conducive 
business environment for private sector investment and address inefficiencies in 
agricultural value chains. Through the set-up of commodity alliance forums, IFAD 
will focus on: (i) facilitating local policy dialogue and influencing local investments 
for inclusive and conducive market linkages; (ii) strengthening quality control, 
grading and standardization systems; and (iii) strengthening community conflict 
management mechanisms. IGREENFIN funding will also promote policy dialogue for 
an adequate policy framework for green agriculture projects. 
C.  Theory of change 
19.  Through the SAPZ programme, the Government is tackling two interrelated 
challenges: (i) meet domestic food requirements and step up local sourcing to 
reduce its food importation bill, and (ii) modernize its farming model to reduce 
rural poverty levels while addressing the impact of climate change on farming 
systems. 
20.  The programme leverages the results of the IFAD-supported VCDP, which has 
demonstrated the feasibility of empowering Nigerian smallholders to enter into 
profitable contract farming with leading agri-business companies on a “win-win” 
basis. IFAD’s support will ensure inclusiveness, namely that vulnerable rural 
households can benefit from these new market outlets by linking 
smallholders/small operators to the SAPZ commercialized system.  
21.  The following outcomes are envisaged: (i) enabling infrastructure, policies and 
regulatory framework for SAPZ; (ii) demand-driven and climate-resilient 
infrastructure; (iii) remunerative and sustainable markets and employment for 
target groups; (iv) access of target groups to formal financial services, including 
for green investments; (v) increase in smallholders’ production and productivity; 
and (vi) improvements in the diets of the targeted population.  
D.  Alignment, ownership and partnerships 
22.  The programme is aligned with key government policies, including the National 
Industrial Revolution Plan, Economic Recovery and Growth Plan, the Medium-Term 
National Development Plan 2021-2025, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and 
Rural Development (FMARD) Green Imperatives Programme and NATIP 2021-2025. 
23.  The programme will contribute to the achievement of the following Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs): no poverty (SDG 1); zero hunger (SDG 2); 
empowerment of women and gender equality (SDG 5); sustained, inclusive and 
4 
EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment (SDG 8); resilient 
infrastructure, promotion of sustainable industrialization and innovation (SDG 9); 
sustainable production (SDG 12); adaptation to climate change (SDG 13); and 
leveraging partnerships with the private sector (SDG 17). The programme is in line 
with the United Nations Sustainable Development Partnership Framework  
(2018-2022) for Nigeria, IFAD’s strategic objectives, the Nigeria country strategic 
opportunities programme and its goal to support a rural economy in which the 
targeted population can achieve prosperity and benefit from economic growth, 
youth in particular. 
24.  The SAPZ programme is unique in that it brings the Government together with key 
international financial institutions operating in the region – AfDB, IFAD and the 
Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) – and also the GCF. The World Bank is already 
considering engaging in phase II. The programme is one of the largest operations 
designed in IFAD11, with total cofinancing envisaged at over US$500 million.  
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
Programme costs 
25.  The programme costs, including contingencies, are estimated at US$541 million 
over seven years of implementation (2022-2028). 
26. 
IFAD will provide a loan of US$49.97 million. AfDB financing will finance 
29.6 per cent of programme costs, or US$160 million, and US$50 million through 
the Africa Growing Together Fund, or 9.2 per cent of programme costs. A total of 
US$60 million will be mobilized through the GCF IGREENFIN programme. 
Cofinancing from IsDB is projected at 27.7 per cent of programme costs, 
amounting to US$150 million. Domestic cofinancing constitutes 4 per cent of 
programme costs, and amounts to US$21.21 million. The US$50.03 million 
financing gap may be filled through subsequent cycles of the performance-based 
allocation system (under financing terms to be determined and subject to 
applicable procedures) or by cofinancing arrangements to be identified during 
implementation. 
27.  Component 1 accounts for 46 per cent of total baseline costs equivalent to 
US$247.58 million, mainly due to the heavy infrastructure to be established. 
Component 2 accounts for 44 per cent of total baseline costs amounting to 
US$236.47 million. Component 3 accounts for 1.6 per cent of total baseline costs 
equivalent to US$8.83 million. Component 4 accounts for 9 per cent of total 
programme baseline costs amounting to US$48.31 million.  
28.  Subcomponent 2.2 – smallholder production/productivity enhancement – is fully 
counted as climate finance. As per the multilateral development banks’ 
methodologies for tracking climate change adaptation and mitigation finance, the 
total amount of IFAD climate finance for this programme is preliminarily calculated 
as US$16,351,000, representing 33 per cent of the total IFAD contribution.

29.  The SAPZ programme has been designed and structured in a manner that any 
delays or non-accrual of activities financed by one partner will have either no or 
minimal impact on other partners’ activities and outcomes. 
Disbursement 
30.  The designated account for the IFAD financing will be operated and replenished 
following imprest account arrangements. Other methods of disbursement may 
include direct payments and reimbursements. After IFAD financing has entered into 
force and the conditions for first disbursement have been duly complied with, and 
upon the request of the borrower, IFAD will make an initial deposit to the 
designated account equal to the requirements for six months’ implementation. The 
proposed thresholds for the statements of expenditures and authorized allocation 
will be outlined in the letter to the borrower. 
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
31.  The estimated cost per beneficiary is US$320. The programme will replicate the 
VCDP approach in other value chains that have been used in the economic and 
financial analysis and the overall programme design approach. The results of the 
economic analysis justify the SAPZ investments. The analysis shows that the 
programme has the capacity to generate an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) 
of 23 per cent. The estimated economic net present value at a 12 per cent discount 
rate is US$47 million, equivalent to Naira 19.5 billion over a seven-year 
implementation period. The benefit-cost ratio of 3.2 indicates a return of US$2.38 
for every dollar invested. These results indicate that the programme is a sound 
investment yielding a positive rate of return as the EIRR is greater than the hurdle 
rate (12 per cent) and the estimated economic net present value is greater than 
zero. 
8 
EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
32.  The exit strategy is built into the programme’s market-driven and resilience-
building approach that focuses on profitable value chains, knowledge transfer, 
time-bound support, improved access to services, infrastructure development and 
the institutionalization of lasting value chain mechanisms, which ensure the 
sustainability of outcomes and results beyond programme completion. The  
AfDB-funded infrastructure aims to crowd in private sector investments and AIHs 
and ATCs will have private sector-led management and revenues to maintain and 
further develop the support infrastructure. IFAD’s extended implementation period 
will ensure support to beneficiaries in taking advantage of the additional markets 
created.  
III.  Risks 
A.  Risks and mitigation measures 
33.  Key risks to programme implementation and proposed mitigation measures are 
summarized in the table below (further details are provided in the integrated 
programme risk matrix).

B.  Environment and social category 
34.  As the lead agency, AfDB’s environmental and social safeguards apply to the 
operation. Given the emphasis on infrastructure financing, the AfDB has classified 
the operation as category 1, equivalent to IFAD’s category A. In accordance with 
its procedures, AfDB has disclosed the relevant documentation to the public for a 
period of 120 days.  
35. 
IFAD has provided additional information on both the IFAD and the Government’s 
websites to complement the AfDB environmental and social assessments. IFAD’s 
background documentation provides more details of the activities it will finance, 
with an emphasis on productive activities and capacity-building. 
36.  The programme interventions entail the following possible environment and social 
risks: (i) deforestation and unsustainable energy sources; (ii) waste management 
and pollution in production and processing; (iii) health and safety in the field; 
(iv) need for eco-friendly land development; (v) land degradation and 
unsustainable land management; (vi) limited land access and social exclusion; and 
(vii) resource conflicts. 
C.  Climate risk classification 
37.  The overall programme has a high climate risk. The main climate change-related 
9 
EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
risks include: flooding, dry spells and drought, resilience and adaptation to climate 
change. Mitigation measures are detailed in the integrated project risk matrix, and 
include climate resilience measures in production and processing through 
awareness campaigns and capacity-building interventions, good agronomic 
practices and improved seedlings, and resource efficiency. These will be further 
strengthened through access to IGREENFIN II funding and climate-resilient and 
low-emission agricultural practices/technologies. 
D.  Debt sustainability  
38.  Nigeria’s public debt remains relatively sustainable but vulnerable to income and 
interest rate shocks. The International Monetary Fund states that despite Nigeria’s 
relatively low debt level, liquidity-based indicators – driven by low revenue 
mobilization – remain a cause for concern, with the interest bill representing a high 
share of government revenue. This makes Nigeria’s low debt-to-GDP ratio highly 
vulnerable to shocks. The interest-to-revenue ratio is particularly vulnerable to a 
real interest rate shock.  
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Programme management and coordination 
39.  The programme will establish a common implementation management framework 
involving all cofinanciers. The Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National 
Planning (FMFBNP) is the designated representative of the borrower and will ensure 
compliance with the loan covenants. FMARD is the lead implementation agency 
working with state Ministries of Agriculture. Oversight and strategic direction for 
implementation of the SAPZ programme will be provided by an Inter-Agency 
Steering Committee. Inter-Agency Technical Committees will be established at the 
national level and in each participating state for review of progress implementation 
and approval of the annual workplan and budget AWP/B. The implementation of 
the programme is delegated by the lead agency to a Federal Programme 
Coordination Unit (FPCU) managing AfDB, IFAD, IsDB and government counterpart 
funds. In line with Nigeria’s federal structure, the FPCU will establish Participating 
States Implementation Units (PSIUs) in each target state.  
Financial management, procurement and governance  
40.  Programme funds will be managed pursuant to the procedures of the Government 
and each cofinancier. These procedures will be detailed in the letter to the 
borrower and the manual of administrative, financial and management procedures. 
41.  The programme will be implemented by jointly funded programme management 
units. Cofinanciers will use the available country systems to the extent possible, 
while ensuring that financial management risks are minimized. IFAD will directly 
disburse funds to the FPCU through the treasury single account of the Federal 
Government and to the PSIUs through the acceptable private commercial banks. 
IFAD will use the Office of the Auditor General for the Federation (OAuGF) for the 
annual programme audit. AfDB will disburse both through the treasury single 
account and through private commercial banks and will explore the use of the 
OAuGF at the federal level and in IFAD.  
42.  Dedicated finance teams at FPCU and PSIU level will be appointed or seconded 
through competitive process. IFAD’s no objection will be required before their 
engagement, as well as to any change in status of key programme staff. 
43.  A joint annual workplan and budget (AWP/B) will be developed by the FPCU and 
PSIUs. This will be approved by the steering committees at the federal and state 
levels and subject to no objection by the cofinanciers. At FPCU and PSIU level, joint 
financial reports will be prepared and submitted to the cofinanciers. Quarterly 
reports will be submitted 45 days after the end of the quarter and annual audited 
10 
EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
reports will be submitted 6 months after year-end at the latest. 
44.  From a country perspective, public access to procurement information and the 
management of procurement complaints are high risk according to the Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Framework. Therefore, IFAD’s 
Procurement Guidelines (and by extension the IFAD Procurement Handbook) will 
apply to all procurement actions, activities and frameworks, with allowances to use 
national systems as long as they are not in conflict with IFAD procurement 
guidelines.  
45.  The FPCU and the PSIUs (in Ogun and Kano) shall each have two procurement 
officers, respectively dedicated to AfDB and IFAD funding. The SAPZ programme 
will have an initial 18-month procurement plan at start-up. Following that, as part 
of the AWP/Bs, each PSIU will prepare and submit annually for approval a 
procurement plan for a 12-month period. 
Target group engagement and feedback and grievance redress 
46.  The SAPZ programme follows a participatory approach at all levels of 
implementation. At the community level, farmers’ organizations will be the entry 
point. Commodity alliance forums will serve as a platform to broker agreements 
between value chain stakeholders, for dispute resolution and grievance redressal 
and to influence policies related to agricultural value chain development. Results 
and plans related to the programme will be widely disseminated among all 
stakeholders.  
Grievance redress 
47.  As soon as programme operations start, a grievance redress mechanism and 
procedures will be made operational through local government channels, in public 
spaces in communities and on local radio reaching target communities. The system 
will be gender and youth sensitive.  
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communications 
48.  Planning. The FPCU will develop a standardized format for the AWP/B. Each PSIU 
will prepare its AWP/B accordingly, planning the activities and investments in its 
state in a participatory manner involving all stakeholders. The FPCU will prepare 
the consolidated AWP/B for the programme based on states’ submissions, to be 
submitted to the Inter-Agency Technical Committee for approval and to AfDB, IsDB 
and IFAD for no objection.  
49.  Monitoring and evaluation. The programme's M&E system will guide  
decision-makers and stakeholders on programme performance and will assess and 
document outcomes and impact. The FPCU will put in place M&E tools and 
procedures according to the Government’s monitoring framework and responding 
to respective cofinanciers monitoring requirements.  
50.  Knowledge management and communication. At inception, the programme 
will elaborate and implement a knowledge management and communication 
strategy including: (i) the documentation of experiences and the capitalization of 
lesson learned on inclusive and pro-smallholder programme approaches in key 
major markets; (ii) the organization of knowledge fairs and learning events; 
(iii) the production and dissemination of educational and communication materials; 
and (iv) the establishment of an electronic library.  
Innovation and scaling up 
51.  The programme is scaling up the IFAD-supported VCDP with key innovative 
features: (i) the piloting of inclusive SAPZs; (ii) the institutionalization of 
commodity alliance forums based on public-private-producer partnerships to 
engage smallholders and other stakeholders in targeted value chains on equal 
footing and a win-win basis; (iii) the expansion of digital extension services; 
11 
EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
(iv) the introduction of blended Green Financing in Nigeria through partnership with 
the GCF; and (v) the mainstreaming of innovative indicators leveraging geospatial 
technology and innovative data analysis tools. 
C.  Implementation plans 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
52.  Start-up is slated for 2022. The following pre-start-up activities are expected from 
national and state governments in Kano and Ogun to ensure that programme  
start-up is not delayed: (i) AWP/B approval for year 1 from state and national 
steering committees; (ii) recruitment of key staff for FPCU and PSIU; (iii) 
programme implementation manual; and (iv) establishment of FPCU and PSIU 
offices.  
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans 
53.  Two joint supervision missions (AfDB, IsDB, IFAD and Government) will be 
undertaken annually to review progress and improve programme implementation. 
The FMFBNP, FMARD, AfDB, IsDB and IFAD will jointly carry out a midterm review 
of programme implementation based on terms of reference prepared by FMARD 
and approved by AfDB, IsDB and IFAD. At programme completion, the Government 
will provide IFAD, IsDB and AfDB with a report on the overall implementation of 
the programme. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
54.  A programme financing agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and 
IFAD will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to 
the borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing is attached as  
appendix I. 
55.  The Federal Republic of Nigeria is empowered under its laws to receive financing 
from IFAD. 
56. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
VI.  Recommendation 
57. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approves the proposed financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on blend terms to the Federal 
Government of Nigeria in an amount of forty-nine million, nine hundred and 
seventy thousand dollars (US$49,970,000) and upon such terms and conditions as 
shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented 
herein.

Oyo, Kwara, Ogun, Imo, Cross River and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). IFAD will focus 
on Kano and Ogun states, leveraging its ongoing programmes. (the “Programme Area”).  
3.  Objectives. The overall objective of the Programme is twofold: 
-  Supporting the development of SAPZs in high food production areas to supply the domestic 
food market and create exportable surpluses (AfDB/IsDB-led). 
-  Empowering smallholders and small operators including women and youth to take advantage 
of  the  markets  created  by  the  SAPZs  to  sustainably  enhance  their  income  and  access  to 
employment, household food security and nutrition, and resilience to climate change (IFAD-
led).  
4. 
Components. The Programme shall consist of the following Components:  
4.1.  Component  1:  Infrastructure  Development  and  Management  for  Agro-Industrial 
Hubs. AfDB and ISDB will lead on the support to the FGN in setting up SAPZs in selected 
high potential areas/states. Each SAPZ will comprise an Agricultural Industrial Hub (AIH) 
and Agricultural Transformation Centres, strategically located within the production area 
to aggregate products from the community, transfer them to the AIHs for value addition 
and  supply  centres  of  demand  for  distribution  and  retail  to  consumers.  This  AfDB-led 
component is fully developed in their Programme Appraisal Report. 
4.2  Component  2:  Agricultural  Productivity,  Production,  Market  Linkages  and  Value 
Addition in SAPZ Catchment Areas. 
4.2.1  
Sub-Component 2.1: Agricultural market linkages and value addition. SAPZ will 
aim at improving the access of smallholder farmers, small scale agro-processors and traders 
to markets, leveraging the significant opportunities offered by the SAPZs and local markets. 
Expected outcomes: (i) increased access to markets of targeted smallholders, small-scale 
processors,  aggregators  and  service  providers;  and  (ii)  climate  resilient  infrastructure  for 
access to markets sustainably managed by the beneficiary communities. 
Sub-Component  2.2:  Smallholder  production/productivity  enhancement.  The 
4.2.2  
sub-component objective is to enhance smallholder farmer productivity on a profitable and 
environmentally  sustainable  basis  to  take  advantage  of  the  additional  market  demand 
created in the SAPZs. Expected outcomes: (i) Farmer Organizations effectively serve their 
members;  and  (ii)  production  and  productivity  of  the  smallholder  farmers  in  the 
Programme Area increases to provide marketable surpluses. 
4.2.3  
Sub-component  2.3  –  Access  to  finance  and  financial  inclusion.  The  sub-
component objective is to facilitate access to appropriate and affordably priced resources 
to  smallholder  farmer  groups,  small  scale  processors  and  other  beneficiary  enterprises 
supported by the Programme. Expected outcome: smallholder farmer groups, processors, 
5 
Appendix I 
EB 2021/134/R.46/Rev.1 
traders  and  community-based  service  providers  access  adapted  and  affordable  formal 
financial services to sustain their agri-enterprises, including for green investments.  
Beneficiaries of the financial services will be the eligible members of FOs supported by the 
Programme. The FOs will play a key role in facilitating access to finance of their members 
from the financial service providers (aggregation of the demand, monitoring of the use of 
the loans, group guarantee, etc.). FOs may also benefit from loans to finance services to 
their  members  as  per  their  business  plans.  The  SAPZ  will  adopt  a  gradual  approach  for 
improving beneficiaries’ access to finance and financial inclusion based on the maturity of 
FOs. 
The activities to be funded by GCF will be described in detail in the GCF loan agreement.  
4.3  Component 3: Policy and Institutional Development Support 
4.3.1  
Under  this  component,  the  Programme  will:  (i)  support  the  development  of 
enabling  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  Agro-Industrial  Zones,  (ii)  facilitate  local 
policy dialogue for conducive and inclusive market linkages, (iii) strengthen quality control, 
grading  and  standardization  systems,  (iv)  establish  and  strengthen  conflict  management 
mechanisms.  While  AfDB  interventions  will  focus  on  all  targeted  states  and  IsDB 
interventions  will focus  on Kano, Kwara and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT);  IFAD-led 
interventions will focus on Ogun and Kano states.

Integrated Programme Risk Matrix (IPRM) 
Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Country Context 
Political Commitment 
Risk(s):  
Poor  governance  and corruption  will  increase  programme  costs  and  compromise 
attainment of the expected impact.  
There is also a risk of political interference in the Programme Management Units at 
National and State levels and inadequate capacity of staff recruited, which affect the 
efficiency and effectiveness of Programme deliveries. 
Mitigations:  
The programme will contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty, particularly 
among the youth, and thereby directly mitigating some of the main underlying 
factors of conflict. It will address the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers 
through CAF. Furthermore, social risks will be reduced through gender-sensitive 
approaches and ensuring that the poor are not excluded from programme benefits. 
Inherent

Governance 
High  
High  
Risk(s):  
Nigeria’s score on the annual Corruption Perceptions Index as published by 
Transparency International for 2020 was 25, placing the country rank at 149 (out 
of 180 countries assessed), which is considered high-risk. Risks related to the 
country’s fragility context, such as poor governance and corruption could increase 
programme costs and compromise attainment of the expected impact. 
Mitigations:  
Supporting enhanced local participation in governance and improved local 
resource management and accountability, as well as involving stakeholders in the 
procurement process of good and services. 
Macroeconomic 
Risk(s):  
Nigeria’s prolonged economic crisis coupled with COVID-19 pandemic resulting in 
increases in the cost of inputs and transportation, and purchasing power of the 
population. This will negatively affect profit margins along the value chains.  
Mitigations:  
The macroeconomic risks will be partly mitigated by the Programme through 
interventions that will reduce transaction costs (resulting from, e.g., economies of 
scale, improved infrastructures and improved access to market information).

Fragility and security 
High  
High  
Risk(s):  
a) Institutional and Social Fragility in Nigeria:  
Despite  Nigeria’s  human and material  resources,  Nigeria is described as  a  badly 
governed  nation  with  several  weak  institutions  incapable  of  ensuring  functional 
policies; where policies exist, they are poorly implemented or entangled in corruption 
or whims of office holders.  
b) Conflict and Violence:   
For  over  a  decade,  Nigeria  has  witnessed  increased  level  of  violent  conflicts 
principally  as  a  result  of  the  Islamic  insurgency  in  the  northeast,  kidnapping  for 
ransom  pervasive  in  the  Northwest  and  farmer-  herder  conflicts  rooted  in  the 
country’s bourgeoning livestock and human population in the face of climate change 
localised in the North Central and southern states. 
c) COVID-19 and Fragility:   
The outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria in March 2020 have worsened the fragility 
situation. 
Mitigations:  
For Ogun state, the following mitigation measures will be taken:  
i) Setting up of conflict early warning committees in project locations especially 
local farmer-herder groups. The Commodity Alliance Forum (CAF) is tailored for 
such purpose.

ii) Regular dialogue/involvement of youth and women groups (including Omo-Inile 
groups as participants in the SAPZ project  
iii) Regular and sustained engagement with local vigilante groups especially 
Amotekun group.  
iv) Avoidance of Egbado North, Egbado South and Ijebu North LGAs as SAPZ 
project locations due to high prevalence of violence.  
v) Appropriate prevention measures including place markers with appropriate 
social distancing (2 meter interval recommended), hand washing facilities and 
compulsory use of face masks. 
For Kano state, the following mitigation measures will be taken:  
i) Getting regular security updates from UNDSS about project location and 
activities to inform programming throughout the duration of the project.  
ii) Setting up of conflict early warning committees in SAPZ project locations. The 
Commodity Alliance Forum (ca) should be utilized for this purpose.  
iii) Complete avoidance of Kano Municipal in the siting of SAPZ projects.   
iv) Direct involvement of typically marginalized groups (women and youth) as 
SAPZ’s direct beneficiaries. Married young women should be deliberately targeted 
to avoid conflict and increase family income. 
v) Strict enforcement of rules guiding use of protective gears, safe distancing to 
avoid the risks of Covid-19.  
Sector Strategies and Policies 
Policy alignment 
Risk(s):  
Agricultural and trade policies are unsupportive to programme goals. The import 
and export policies on rice, cassava wheat and poultry can negatively impact 
market prices and significantly reduce the profit margins along the value chains. 
Mitigations:  
The Programme will support FMARD to review and advocate for appropriate policy 
support for the products supported by the programme. 
Substantial   Moderate

Substantial  Moderate  
Policy development & implementation 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial  Moderate  
Risk(s):  
The risk faced for SAPZ is to stay aligned to the country's different development 
strategies and policies. Nigeria has several key strategies as below:  
- The Economic Growth and Recovery Plan 2017-20 (EGRP). 
- The Vision 20:20 Road Map which emphasises a diversified private sector-led 
economy, agricultural growth, and employment creation. 
- The Green Alternative Roadmap for Agriculture, which prioritizes four pillars: food 
security, job creation, import substitution and economic diversification using a 
decentralized coordination framework 
- The Strategic Framework for Youth Employment and Job Creation of the FMARD 
which emphasizes youth employment in agriculture. 
Mitigations:  
The  development  of  SAPZ  across  the  country  is  a  key  element  of  Nigeria’s 
agricultural transformation agenda, the Economic Growth and Recovery Plan 2017-
20 (EGRP).  
The FMARD is also working on a the medium term Agricultural policy strategy of 
FMARD which is encapsulated in the Agricultural Technology and innovation plan 
(NATIP).The NATIP is built on the following seven strands :i. Knowledge creation 
and Transfer; Rural access to mechanisation; Comprehensive extensive services; 
Value-addition; Market Development; Sustainable funding ; and Synergy and MDA 
Alignment.  
The  SAPZs  project  is  designed  as  strategy  to  generate  mutual  benefits  for 
smallholders and agro-processing firms including youth and women. With SAPZs, 
the  Nigerian  Government  aims  to  attract  the  private  sector  to  set  up  processing 
plants in zones of high food production and process commodities into food products, 
while generating increased income generating opportunities for smallholders who 
account for the majority of the poor. The expected outcome is that food systems are 
improved, smallholders have increased and secured outlets for the competitive sell 
of their produce, and off-takers have a secured supply of produce in the required 
quantity and quality to supply Nigeria’s huge food market.

support to the Agro-Industrialization agenda.  
Environment and Climate Context  
Project vulnerability to environmental conditions 
High  
Substantial 
Substantial  Moderate  
Risk(s):  
Deforestation  and  woodland  degradation  risk  is  a  significant  risk.  The  use  of 
firewood for small-holder processing, land clearing for new farms, and development 
of market infrastructure are likely to increase forest and woodland losses in SAPZ 
project  area.  In  addition,  SAPZ  production  activities  will  likely  trigger  land/  soil 
degradation including erosion. 
Mitigations:  
SAPZ will promote use of alternative energy to fuel wood for processing and also 
land  development  and 
promote  agroforestry.  Where 
construction  of  market  infrastructure  is  unavoidable,  this  will  be  compensated  by 
tree replanting along the constructed roads and hedges along the farm boundaries. 
Contractors will be required to produce EMSP for market infrastructure. SAPZ will 
also  promote  Good  Agricultural  Practices  through  training  on  sustainable  land 
development and preparation methods.

Project vulnerability to climate change impacts 
High  
Substantial  
Risk(s):  
Projected  climatic  changes  suggest  that  due  to  the  increase  in  the  variability  of 
climatic conditions, SAPZ project areas will experience fluctuations in temperatures 
and  precipitation  which  can  hamper  smallholder  agricultural  value  chains.  Both 
rainfall  and  temperature  are  likely  to  increase  with  possibility  of  more  disastrous 
floods. With the increase of dry spells, there could an increase of droughts during 
the wet season and rain during the dry season. Increased intensity when coupled 
with  land  clearing  means  a  greater  risk  of  surface  runoff  and  topsoil  erosion, 
increased  risk  of  river  damage  to  road  infrastructure  and  increased  risks  of 
landslides. 
Mitigations:  
SAPZ  will  integrate  climate  resilience  measures  through  capacity  building 
programmes  in  climate  smart  agricultural  strategies,  strong  collaboration  with 
extension  and  climate  information  services,  good  agronomic  practices  and  ‘no 
regrets’  mechanisms.  The  IGREENFIN  financing  mechanism  will  be  accessed  to 
finance some of the climate mitigation and adaptation activities. 
Project Scope 
Project relevance  
Risk(s): There is a risk of Nigeria's agricultural and trade policies and economic 
environment being unsupportive to programme goals. This will effect the import 
and export polices on rice and cassava can negatively impact market prices and 
significantly reduce the profit margins along the Value Chains. 
Mitigations:  
In  its  Agriculture  Promotion  Policy  (2016-2020),  the  Government’s  four  main 
priorities  are:  food  security,  import  substitution,  job  creation  and  economic 
diversification. The project is being developed at the request of the Government and 
its objectives and targets are a Government priority.  
The  development  of  SAPZs  across  the  country  is  a  key  element  of  Nigeria’s 
agricultural transformation agenda, the Economic Growth and Recovery Plan 2017-
20 (EGRP). The SAPZs project is designed as strategy to generate mutual benefits 
for smallholders and agro-processing firms including youth and women.  
SAPZ will contribute to IFAD’s overarching strategic goal to support rural people to 
overcome poverty and achieve food security through remunerative, sustainable and 
resilient livelihoods

Risk(s):  
The Procurement Act has been reviewed in 2016 and the risk for its use is rated at 
“Moderate” because the Act does not allow participation of foreign firms in National 
Competitive  Bidding  opportunities.  The  National  Standard  Bidding  document  for 
goods, works, and services, including General Conditions of Contracts (GCC) for 
public  sector  contracts,  and  the  dispute  resolution  mechanism  and  enforcement 
procedures of outcome of the dispute resolution process, have been reviewed and 
the risk for its use is rated at “moderate” due to the following reasons:  
a)  There  are  standard  solicitation  documents  for  consulting  services,  Goods  and 
works available to public on the BPP website.  
b) There are standard and mandatory set of clauses or templates that are reflective 
of the legal framework for use in documents prepared for competitive bidding;  
c) The documents are kept up to date and guidelines are prepared to facilitate their 
use. Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) has the responsibility of the preparation 
and update. 
The legal provisions, including the institutions in charge of dealing with prohibited 
practices (corruption, fraud, conflict of interest, and unethical behavior), which also 
define  responsibilities,  accountabilities  and  penalties  for  prohibited  practices,  has 
been reviewed and the risk is rated at “Low” due to the following provisions: (a) it is 
a punishable offence to conduct or attempt to conduct procurement fraud by means 
of fraudulent and corrupt acts, unlawful influence, undue interest, favor, agreement, 
bribery or corruption (PPA Art. 58 (3) b). A section on fraud and Corrupt practices 
covering  Corrupt,  Fraudulent,  Collusive,  Coercive  and  Obstructive  Practices  is 
included  in  the  Bidding  Documents;  and  (b)  detailed  Code  of  Conduct  for  Public 
Procurement is covered in Art, 57; and all offences relating to Public Procurement 
in Art. 58. 
Mitigations:  
Based on the OECD/DAC  MAPs tool, a Rational for Assessing Critical Indicators 
(RACI) review of the Nigeria public procurement System has been performed and 
led to the conclusions that the system was not found reliable for its use in the project. 
The review has also identified additional risks within the procurement system which 
may affect the efficiency of procurement operations, namely: absence of acceptable 
range of benchmark costs; inadequate preparation of investment projects prior to

late release of budgeted funds; lack of budget-linked procurement planning; failure 
of full compliance with the use of standard bidding documents; poor bid evaluation

the  tendering  and  expenditure  management  processes;  applying  the  ‘shopping’ 
method for higher value procurements inconsistent with the applicable rules and the 
methods  defined  in  the  procurement  plans;  splitting  procurement  packages  to 
circumvent procurement thresholds; payment to suppliers who have not delivered 
the  goods  or  have  delivered  sub-standard  goods  and  several  different  suppliers 
sharing the same address – an apparent sign of collusion and attempt to show that 
there was competition; inflated costs (sometimes twice) on procurement of goods; 
etc. 
The following mitigation measures should be taken in order to address these issues:  
1. Ensure effective coordination at Federal and State level in terms of sequencing 
of implementation to ensure synchronization of procurements by different donors.  
2.  Ensure  effective  coordination  between  Federal  and  State  level  in  terms  of 
sequencing  of  implementation  to  ensure  synchronization  of  procurements  by

Risk(s):  
There  are  inadequate  accountability  and  control  mechanisms,  including  lack  of 
separation  of  implementation  from  regulatory  functions;  involvement  of  political 
appointees in procurement decisions; lack of enforcement of sanctions and weak 
capacity of the judiciary to adjudicate on procurement infractions. There is presence 
of bidder cartels; corrupt and fraudulent practices in procurement processes. 
The existing complaints system has been reviewed to ensure that it set out clear 
specific conditions that provide for fairness, independent and due process, and the 
risk for its use in Bank-financed projects is rated at “Moderate” due to the following 
reasons:  (a)  the  Federal  High  Courts  are not  dedicated  to  receive  and  discharge 
appeals on procurement complaint within specified periods. Litigation may unduly 
take long period. No independent administrative reviewing body; (b) there are no 
established procedure to conduct independent Administrative Review; and (c) there 
are no independent Administrative Review Body. 
The Regulatory body has been assessed to ensure that it is not responsible for direct 
procurement  operations  and  is  free  from  other  possible  conflicts  of  interest  in 
procurement, and the risk for its use in Bank-financed projects is rated at “High” due 
to the fact that though the BPP monitors public procurement proceedings and deals 
with  any  identified  irregularities,  it  is  also  required  to  provide  certification  on  the 
procurement decisions of the PE for certain thresholds determined by the Council. 
Thus giving the Bureau a dual responsibility when handling complaints, which may 
put it in a potential conflicting position with its oversight role.

Funded Projects, there is a substantial risk of land.  
• This is the case with the NPMU which sources staff from the federal civil service 
and even more prevalent with the SPMUs at state level.   
• Delays in recruitment of key project staff has also often had a knock-on effect on 
the prompt start-up of other IFAD-financed projects. 
Mitigations:  
•  The  project  will  receive  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  at  the 
programme  inception.  This  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  could  be 
delivered  by  the  Finance  and  Audit personnel of  CPAT  or an  external consultant

account (Project Account A) in Naira. The federal counterpart funds are deposited 
in a separate federal counterpart fund account. The NPC is authorized to manage 
both  the  DA  and  the  federal  counterpart  fund  account.  Each  state  operates  two 
accounts in Naira: (i) A state project account (Project Account B) to receive IFAD 
loan funds from the Project Account A; (ii) and a state counterpart fund account to 
receive  state  counterpart  funds.  Each  SPC  is  authorized  to  manage  the  Project 
Account B and the state counterpart funds account.

and  installation  of  the  software  will  be  included  as  one  of  the  activities  to  be 
considered in the FIPS.  
•  Staff  who  have  experience  with  IFAD  projects  will  be  recruited  for  the  PMU  if 
possible. The PMU will be established before the loan becomes effective.  
•  The  knowledge  and  experience  with  these  systems  will  be  included  in  the

In respect of Gender:  
The gender strategy and action plan will be prepared as per usual practice – 
based on a deeper gender analysis that highlights barriers to women’s full 
participation in the proposed project intervention areas. The strategy will also 
identify the human and financial resources needed to address gender and social 
inclusion. SAPZ will implement the Gender Action Learning System (GALS) to 
empower beneficiaries to address underlying gender barriers limiting women’s and 
household progression. Furthermore, policy engagement will include a continuous 
focus on: (i) enhancing rural finance access for women to engage in agribusiness; 
(ii) improving access to markets; and (iii) facilitating better access to land for 
women to overcome the cultural barriers that limit women's ownership of land for 
agricultural production. Gender will also be mainstreamed in SAPZ’s Monitoring 
and Evaluation System. To that end, the design team will also include an expert on 
social inclusion to ensure that IFAD assumes leadership in this area throughout 
design and implementation. 
In respect of Youth:  
The Project will encompass a youth strategy and action plan. As per usual practice, 
this strategy will identify priorities and actions acknowledging the differences within 
the  group,  with  a  particular  focus  on  potential  vulnerabilities  affecting  specific 
sections  within  the  youth  category  (e.g.  ensure  young  women  have  equitable 
opportunities with the young men to participate and benefit from the project, special 
provisions for youth with disabilities, young IDPs). It will leverage approaches of the 
LIFE-ND  project,  specifically  the  youth  incubator  model.  Creation  of  employment 
opportunities and reducing poverty, particularly among the youth and thus reduce

greenhouse gases (especially methane) from rice paddies remains is significant in 
SAPZ. 
Mitigations:  
SAPZ will promote the use of clean energy in production and processing. The project 
will also train farmers on how to  drain rice paddies in mid-season to reduce CH4 
emission, as well and improvement in nutrient management including the retention 
of rice residues. Agroforestry and climate-smart production and processing will be 
promoted.

Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Vulnerability of target populations and ecosystems to climate variability and 
hazards 
Risk(s):  
Smallholder agricultural production in the SAPZ project areas are substantially tied 
to  climate-dependent  natural  resources.  Hence,  some  of  the  subprojects  will  be 
located  in  high  exposure  low-lying  river  valleys  and  semi-arid  zones  that  are 
vulnerable to the risk of extreme climatic events, especially flooding, dry spells and 
drought.  These  can  be  exacerbated  by  projected  changes  in  future  climate  with 
significant  impacts  for  agricultural  productivity  and  market  infrastructure  and 
concomitant  impacts  on  livelihoods,  food  security,  poverty,  and  loss  of  project 
investments. 
Mitigations:  
SAPZ will strengthen collaboration with NIMET, deepen climate information-guided 
value  chain  and  strengthen  extensions  services  for  climate  smart  and  good 
agricultural practices including use of flood and drought tolerant cultivars, timing of 
cropping cycle to stave-off flood, and use of residual moisture to enhance production 
during the dry season. 
In  line  with  the  AfDB’s  Climate  Risk  Management  and  Adaptation  Strategy,  the 
SAPZ project will ensure that the infrastructure developed under the project will be 
climate  proofed  and  that  climate  change  adaptive  responses  and  mitigation 
strategies are adopted. IFAD will help ensure a producer-centric approach to climate 
resilience  building  with  a  focus  on  livelihoods.  In  addition,  the  SAPZ  project  will 
implement in Nigeria the Inclusive Green Finance Initiative (financed by  the GCF) 
which aims to unlock green financing to support low emission and climate resilient 
agriculture. This initiative seems to be under formulation. Information on expected 
effectiveness has not been provided. 
The use of private sector extension service providers through FFS has proven to be 
key  to  the  high  performance  of  smallholders  in  productivity  and  production 
enhancement.

Moderate   Moderate  
Risk(s):  
There are risks such as:  
1) Resistance to programme interventions and conflicts between actors 
2) Ineffective collaboration among public actors, farmers and private sectors 
organizations, affecting implementation of the 4P model.  
3) The implementation of the project’s gender mainstreaming approach is not 
adequately prioritized and considered as “business as usual”.  
4) Lack of maintenance of infrastructures supported by the project. 
Mitigations:  
To mitigate the risks, SAPZ will  
1) Strengthen and institutionalize the CAF and supporting off-takers to develop 
their services for the farmers.  
2) Invest substantial efforts in providing all stakeholders directly involved in 
managing project activities with the support to equip them to do so.  
3) Set up Operations and Maintenance Committees to strengthen community 
ownership and sustainability. 
Stakeholder grievances  
Risk(s):  
Ineffective coordinating structures at National, State and Local Government levels 
leads to poor implementation resulting from in adequate supervision and oversight. 
Mitigations:  
Inception workshop will be organized to clarify the roles of coordinating structure to 
achieve Programme results. Capacity building of members of coordination 
structures and quarterly meetings to review implementation progress will be taken 
place.
