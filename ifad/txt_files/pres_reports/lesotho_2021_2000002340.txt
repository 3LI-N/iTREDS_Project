Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in 
paragraph 54. 
I.  Context 
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
1. 
National context 
Economic outlook. The Kingdom of Lesotho recently graduated to lower-middle-
income country status, yet nearly 50 per cent of its population still lives below the 
national poverty line (US$1.65 per day). Lesotho’s GDP growth – 1.13 per cent 
between 2015 and 2020 – is projected to slow to 0.6 per cent in the coming years. 
This trend is attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The national debt 
currently amounts to about 47 per cent of GDP.1 
2.  Demography and human development. Lesotho’s population is about 
2.1 million, with approximately 80 per cent of people living in rural areas. The 
country’s Human Development Index stands at 0.497. Lesotho suffers from 
widespread hunger2 and high prevalence of HIV/AIDS (23.4 per cent in 2017).3 The 
latter has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the country, but 
both diseases present serious national health and economic challenges. Life 
expectancy is 54 years.4 
3. 
4. 
Agriculture and food security. Agricultural production is the leading source of 
livelihoods for rural populations, with 70 per cent of households partly depending 
on it. Agriculture accounted for 8 per cent of GDP in 2018 and the sector employs 
44 per cent of the active population. Lesotho is a small, landlocked country whose 
macroeconomic stability depends on economic trends in South Africa. It also 
suffers from the economies of scale of neighboring producers. The majority of food 
consumed in the country is imported. Difficult agroclimatic conditions and limited 
arable land result in low agricultural growth.  
Policies and programmes. Lesotho, a constitutional monarchy, is governed as a 
parliamentary democracy. The country has experienced recurrent periods of 
political instability. The 2019-2023 National Strategic Development Plan 
emphasizes the critical importance of agriculture to the rural poor and sets three 
goals for the sector: (i) sustainable commercialization and diversification; 
(ii) development of agrifood systems; and (iii) rehabilitation of rangelands and 
wetlands. A comprehensive multisectoral national framework addressing rural 
challenges is lacking. 
5. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
In line with mainstreaming commitments under the Eleventh Replenishment of 
IFAD's Resources (IFAD11), the project has been validated as: 
☒ Including climate finance; and 
☒ Nutrition-sensitive. 
6.  Gender. Women in Lesotho account for most of the agricultural labour force and 
provide considerable inputs to household food security. However, their role is 
undervalued and constrained by controls over resources, services and the labour

EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
market opportunities. Gender-based violence is common (86 per cent of women 
affected).5 Despite notable advances, economic and social disparities persist. 
7. 
Youth. Lesotho has a young population – 39 per cent of inhabitants are between 
15 and 35 years old. Unemployment affects 15.3 per cent of those aged between 
25 and 29, a figure that rises to 36 per cent for rural youth. Orphans account for 
54.3 per cent of young people aged below 18 (largely reflecting HIV/AIDS deaths). 
Overall, rural youth lack access to productive assets, finance, and skills 
development.  
8.  Nutrition. Malnutrition is rife in Lesotho. This translates into high stunting rates in 
children under the age of five (33 per cent), with significant disparities across the 
country. Poor nutrition explains high level of anaemia (51 per cent of children 
under five) and overweight (45 per cent of women between 15 and 49 years old). 
9. 
Environment and climate change. Climate change simulations see temperatures 
increasing between 1.5°C and 2°C and a reduction of total monthly precipitation of 
approximately 5.5 per cent by 2050.6 Recurrent droughts will result in reduced 
water availability for a predominantly rainfed agriculture. Other potential climate 
impacts include crop failures due to heat and drought stress, production losses 
caused by unpredictable rains, reduced planting area, and increased susceptibility 
to pests and disease. 
10.  Rationale for IFAD involvement. The Regeneration of Landscapes and 
Livelihoods (ROLL) project is an opportunity for IFAD to capitalize on 40 years of 
engagement with the Government of Lesotho and help drive coordinated efforts on 
regeneration. The project aims to bring together key development partners, 
notably the World Bank, FAO and the World Food Programme, not only in pursuit of 
the Fund’s own strategic objectives (SOs), but also to contribute to the goals of the 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework. IFAD has also successfully 
mobilized cofinancing from GEF and OPEC Fund, ROLL will reaffirm IFAD’s 
leadership in innovative rural finance in the region. 
B.  Lessons learned 
11.  ROLL draws on lessons from Lesotho and beyond. The country strategy and 
opportunities programme (COSOP) (1998–2018) results review highlighted the 
need for ongoing support to address the dual burden of extensive rural degradation 
and persistent rural poverty. Behaviour change and more sustainable resource use 
do take time and require continuous engagement together with, ideally, smart 
incentives. 
12.  A careful analysis of previous experience in community-driven labour schemes and 
related innovation, monitoring instruments and scaling-up mechanisms7 informed 
the project’s objectives and approach. The project learns from the Wool and Mohair 
Promotion Project’s experience in road construction and from the intervention of 
the Ministry of Forestry, Range and Soil Conservation (MFRSC) on labour schemes, 
as well as from international experience in setting up benefit-sharing mechanisms8 
and performance-based support options.9 
II.  Project description 
A.  Objectives, geographical area of intervention and target 
groups 
13.  The project development objective is to ensure that rural communities adopt 
transformational practices for regenerated landscapes and sustainable livelihoods,

leading to improved nutrition and adaptation to climate change. This objective is 
underpinned by four outcomes: (i) changed resource use practices; (ii) reduction of 
environmental degradation; (iii) improved livelihoods; and (iv) the establishment of 
a facility and a fund for landscape regeneration. Project duration is set at eight 
years. 
14.  Geographic area of intervention. ROLL is national in scale, and will initiate 
operations in five districts, namely Thaba-Tseka, Leribe, Berea, Qachas Nek and 
Botha-Bothe. It will work in landscapes in 16 subcatchments, 1,000 villages and 
the same number of coalitions and groups (grazing associations, women’s saving 
groups, herder groups). The selection of subcatchments and landscapes is 
informed by key biophysical and socio-economic variables on climate vulnerability.  
15.  Target groups and strategy. About 100,000 people and 68,000 rural households 
will directly benefit from the project. On average, rural households in Lesotho have 
five members, which adds up to 340,000 beneficiaries. Vulnerable rural households 
are the main target group, comprising small-scale producers (poor farmers, 
livestock owners and herders), unemployed youth and wage labourers. ROLL’s 
targeting strategy follows a three-pronged approach in pursuit of the project’s 
objectives. For environmental management, sensitization at the village level will 
promote large community participation. For household income generation, an 
approach that focuses on the poor and is gender sensitive will reach the most 
vulnerable. For awareness-raising, national campaigns (radio and TV) and visits to 
schools will be undertaken. 
16.  Gender, youth and nutrition. Among other instruments, the project integrates 
the Gender Action Learning System and other household methodologies to 
strengthen the social capital of target groups. Quotas will be set to meet the 
targets of 40 per cent women’s participation and of 20 per cent youth engagement. 
Similarly, the first two components aim to improve nutrition by enhancing food 
security through the following: (i) supporting production of diverse and nutritious 
foods; (ii) promoting household consumption of safe and nutritious foods; 
(iii) improving household hygiene; and (iv) providing opportunities for women to 
access and control productive resources and income-generating activities. Nutrition 
interventions will seek to reach at least a third of project beneficiaries. 
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
17.  The project will have the following components: (i) regeneration coalition facility; 
(ii) regeneration opportunities fund (ROF); and (iii) project management and 
coordination. 
18. 
Component A. Regeneration coalition facility 
In this component, community members and local interest groups in a landscape 
are brought together under the umbrella of a landscape coalition. The expected 
outcome is to support coalitions of local groups and decision-makers to engage in 
landscape regeneration efforts. Component A rests on three main groups of 
complementary activities: 
(i)  Scoping and assessments. In line with the strong focus on participation, 
this set of activities includes: (i) mapping existing community-based 
organizations and ascertaining the perceived levels of social cohesion; and  
(ii) assessing environmental and socio-economic challenges and 
opportunities, including those related to natural resource management. Both 
will be facilitated by the project and service providers, and carried out by the 
communities.  
(ii)  Coalition-building. As an interactive process within project villages, 
coalitions are formed consisting of local organizations, farmers and villagers. 
The process entails: (i) participatory awareness-raising on sustainable natural 
resource management and requests to the communities to define alleviation 
3 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
measures; and, subsequently, (ii) the formalization of the coalitions, which 
then can submit funding requests to the ROF's various windows.  
(iii)  Planning, mobilization and implementation. This set of activities 
includes: (i) technical assistance for landscape assessment and planning; 
(ii) support to coalitions for submitting plans to ROF; and (iii) continuous 
assistance to strategy implementation.  
(iv)  Nutrition and social inclusion demonstration. A set of activities is 
programmed around nutrition-related activities, using five pathways: 
increasing production, promoting consumption, improving hygiene, enhancing 
women’s access to productive resources, and supporting nutrition education. 
ROLL will develop a gender and youth strategy and action plan to facilitate 
equitable participation of women and men. 
Component B. Regeneration opportunities fund  
19.  The ROF seeks to catalyse investments in activities benefiting the people and the 
environment equally. The fund is subject to strict disbursement conditions and 
mid-course performance audits. Its long-term sustainability will be supported 
through cofinancing and partnerships formed during the project. ROF is set up with 
a phased approach and comprises three funding windows providing technical and 
financial support: 
(i) 
The landscape support window is aimed at coalitions and groups, including 
those of women and youth in landscapes, and will provide support for  
labour-based schemes, such as the debrushing and reseeding of degraded 
lands; for small green and grey infrastructure for soil and water conservation; 
and for community projects on forestry or biodiversity enhancement. 
(ii)  The sustainable enterprises window is aimed at rural enterprises that 
want to transition into more sustainable practices. The window provides for 
technical assistance that will include financial skills and business development 
skills targeting youth and women. 
(iii)  The innovation window is aimed at enterprises, groups and civil society 
organizations pursuing innovations to regenerate landscapes. The window will 
provide seed funding to support the research, development and piloting of 
such innovations, jointly with landscape coalitions active in ROLL. It will 
explicitly target 20 per cent of youth. 
Component C. Project management and coordination 
20.  This component will serve to facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of 
components A and B. It includes (i) project monitoring and evaluation; (ii) policy 
engagement; (iii) knowledge management functions; (iv) coordination of 
innovative activities; and (v) partnership management. 
C.  Theory of change 
21.  ROLL’s theory of change is premised on the understanding that rural poverty and 
environmental degradation are mutually reinforcing, which results in a downward 
spiral of overexploited natural resources and declining productivity. The theory of 
change links strongly to the landscape graduation model.10 A participatory and 
iterative process, it engages local communities, including vulnerable groups, in: 
(i) defining environmental challenges; (ii) identifying appropriate actions; and 
(iii) building necessary commitments to ensure effective implementation of 
landscape regeneration measures.  
22.  The use of a graduation model allows for differentiated targeting and support. The 
facility under component A will support communities in establishing landscape 
10 The graduation model will guide coalitions in determining the best strategy to regenerate the landscape and to determine 
eligibility for ROF funding. 
4 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
coalitions and in agreeing on a set of interventions and targets. The fund under 
component B will provide different tailored technical and financial support for the 
interventions decided by the coalitions. The income generated through productive 
investments is expected to diversify the community’s economic opportunities and 
diet. The adoption of sustainable resource use practices will contribute to landscape 
regeneration. 
D.  Alignment, ownership and partnerships 
23.  The project aims to contribute to the sustainable development goals (SDGs): 
SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 
SDG 15 (life on land). It will make significant contributions to SDG 2 (zero hunger), 
SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 13 (climate action). It seeks to strengthen the 
environmental sustainability and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic 
activities (IFAD SO3) while promoting diversified rural enterprise and employment 
opportunities (IFAD SO2). 
24.  ROLL will work on strengthening the regulatory and policy frameworks that affect 
outcomes. This will be done together with the Government and other development 
partners within the working group on natural resource management, which include 
GIZ, the European Union, the World Bank, the Millennium Challenge Corporation 
and key governments. Most of ROLL’s policy-related work will be around creating 
awareness and community mobilization to promote the rollout and the enforcement 
of updated regulations such as the Rangeland Management Act. 
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
25.  The project finance contains a gap of US$3.5 million which may be closed through 
performance-based allocation system cycles (under financing terms and subject to 
internal procedures and Executive Board approval) or by cofinancing identified 
during implementation. Targets will be adjusted accordingly, following the scalable 
approach. 
26.  ROLL component B (ROF) is partially counted as climate finance. Under the 
multilateral development banks’ methodologies, US$6.55 million is climate finance 
(58 per cent of the total IFAD financing) consisting of US$4.53 million in adaptation 
and US$2.02 million in mitigation finance. 
Project costs 
27.  The total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, are 
US$46.348 million (LSL 741.572 million) over eight years. Total base costs amount 
to US$43.026 million; physical and price contingencies are estimated to add 
US$3.323 million to this amount. Component A accounts for 28 per cent, 
component B for 53 per cent, and component C for 19 per cent of total base costs. 
The total of IFAD’s contribution to ROLL is estimated at US$11.3 million 
(24 per cent), under a highly concessional loan (33 per cent of IFAD financing) and 
a blend terms loan (67 per cent).

Financing and cofinancing strategy 
28.  The total projects costs will be financed by (i) two IFAD loans for a total amount of 
US$11.3 million; (ii) an OPEC Fund loan of US$15.0 million; (iii) an OPEC Fund 
grant of US$0.5 million; (iv) a GEF grant (US$3.5 million); (v) FAO in-kind 
cofinancing (US$2.4 million); (vi) Government of Lesotho contribution of  
US$7.994 million; (vii) the beneficiaries contribution in-kind (US$2.155 million); 
and (viii) a financing window of US$3.5 million. The Government contribution of 
US$7.994 million includes US$0.980 million as taxes and duties foregone. 
Disbursement 
29.  The project will open separate designated accounts at the Central Bank of Lesotho, 
one to receive funds from the IFAD loans, the others for the GEF Grant and OPEC 
Fund loan/grant once respective cofinancing agreements are finalized. The project 
will maintain corresponding operating bank accounts in local currency in 
commercial banks, including one operational account for the Government’s 
contribution. The project coordination unit (PCU) will manage the operating 
accounts. The PIM will ensure a clear framework to measure and monitor in-kind 
contributions. 
30.  ROF will be the disbursement window for resources under component B. The 
financing agreement will detail specific disbursement conditions for the fund. 
Additional designated accounts may be opened as required to receive financing 
allocated under component B. Performance audits, carried out on reaching agreed 
expenditure thresholds, will be set as a condition for ROF to progressively access 
financing. Disbursements to participating service providers will be based on the 
agreed annual workplan and budget (AWP/B). 
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
31.  The economic rate of return is estimated at 17.5 per cent. Expected direct benefits 
include; (i) improved income from on-farm activities; (ii) increased food 
availability; and (iii) profitable income-generating activities. Other benefits include: 
(i) creation of 5,525 new/sustainable income-generating activities targeting women 
and youth, (ii) sustained permanent employment through the income-generating 
activities (iii) foreign exchange savings as a result of increased production and 
reduced imports; and (iv) substantial positive fiscal impact, due to: (a) increased 
output, income, and employment, and (b) multiplier effects from increased 
economic activity in the targeted districts. 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
32.  The project‘s emphasis is on self-sustaining natural resource management at the 
individual and community level. The landscape graduation model is designed to 
progressively shift from high dependence on public investment by increasing the 
responsibility of targeted communities and private sector investment. The exit 
pathway at the institutional level will be shaped by the partnerships formed at 
project implementation. Efforts to develop ROF as a fully operational legal entity 
through capacitation and joint resource mobilization aim to ensure its efficiency 
and sustainability. 
III.  Risks 
A.  Risks and mitigation measures 
33.  The overall inherent risk rating is substantial. After mitigation measures, the 
residual risk is moderate. The risk subcategories rated highest are: (i) country 
context, (ii) procurement and (iii) financial management. The residual risk after 
accounting for mitigation measures of the selected risk subcategories is moderate 
to substantial.

B.  Environment and social category 
34.  The environmental and social categorization is B. Given the environmental 
management orientation of the project, the expected environmental impacts are 
positive and any potential negative impacts are site specific and reversible. 
Potential negative social impacts might stem from temporary or structurally 
reduced access to natural resources. The project will deploy participatory methods 
to ensure that targeted communities are aware of potential effects and possible 
alternative options. 
C.  Climate risk classification 
35.  The climate risk classification is moderate. A basic climate risk analysis illustrates 
the implications of climate change and integrate the findings into the participatory 
processes for implementation. Specific measures to promote climate-smart 
agriculture (with climate change adaptation and mitigation benefits) have been 
integrated into the environmental and social management framework.  
D.  Debt sustainability  
36.  Lesotho’s external debt risk changed to moderate “with limited space”, from “with 
some space”.11 The present value of public and publicly guaranteed external debt 
in relation to GDP is expected to approach 40 per cent in fiscal year 2020-2021, 
(10 points higher than the 2019 Debt Sustainability Analysis [DSA]) due to the 
COVID-19 crisis and recent exchange rate depreciation. It is expected to slowly 
decline, as domestic borrowing expands and financing needs decline. External debt 
(three-quarters of total debt) is largely owed to multilateral creditors on a 
concessional basis. The main creditors are the International Development 
Association, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund. The main bilateral creditors are China and Kuwait. 
Lesotho is participating in the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, which offers 
potential savings of US$9.8 million (0.4 per cent of 2019’s GDP). 
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Project management and coordination 
37.  ROLL will be coordinated by a project management unit (PMU). The PMU will be 
housed at the MFRSC, with involvement of the Ministry of Tourism, Environment 
and Culture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, the Ministry of Local 
11 World Bank/International Monetary Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis of July 2020. 
8 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
Government and Chieftainship Affairs, the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sports and 
Recreation, and the Ministry of Water and other relevant ministries as required. 
Project delivery will be focused at the local level, directed by local councils in close 
collaboration with traditional authorities. Service providers and technical expertise 
will be recruited for specific interventions. 
38.  The Project Steering Committee (PSC) will consist of directors from line ministries 
and NGOs; crop farmers and livestock owners; and representatives of the private 
sector and civil society. The Committee will provide strategic oversight and approve 
the AWP/B and procurement plans plus progress reports, including financial 
reports. The Technical Advisory Committee is an interministerial body set up to 
support project implementation and prepare PSC meetings and decisions. FAO as a 
cofinancing party with an in-country presence, will play a key strategic role in 
technical backstopping and managing the political context and mitigating its 
influence on the project.  
Financial management, procurement and governance  
39.  Financial management will be centralized and operated by the PMU. The accounts 
will be prepared in accordance with the International Public Sector Accounting 
Standards. Disbursement will follow the imprest account mechanism, 
supplemented by reimbursement mechanisms and direct payments in compliance 
with IFAD guidelines. The project’s Inherent risk is thus mitigated from high to 
moderate. The project will be visible on the IFAD Client Portal.  
40.  The MFRSC internal audit will provide regular review audits. The project will submit 
quarterly interim statements to IFAD for reporting purposes. The external audit of 
the project will be undertaken by the Office of the Auditor-General of the 
Government of Lesotho in conformity with IFAD guidelines on audits for IFAD-
funded projects. 
41.  The procurement risk matrix for ROLL indicates a substantial inherent risk rating of 
1.87. Given the low procurement capacity of the MFRSC, the PMU will set up a 
competent procurement team. The MFRSC and the procurement team will be 
supported by a procurement technical assistant for the tender evaluation panel and 
major procurements. The PMU will receive procurement training organized by IFAD 
following an assessment of capacity needs.  
42.  The Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranks Lesotho as at 
moderate risk (41 points in 2020). Strict compliance with the IFAD Policy on 
Preventing Fraud and Corruption in its Activities and Operations will be required. 
The project will ensure total adherence to IFAD’s policy on preventing and 
responding to sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse. All procurement 
entities, bidders, suppliers, contractors, consultants and service providers will be 
required to observe the highest ethical standard in accordance with paragraph 69 
of the IFAD Project Procurement Guidelines. 
Project target group engagement and feedback, and grievance redress12 
43.  Targeted communities will play a central role in monitoring the project’s activities 
and results. Communities will set their own targets and monitor progress. ROLL will 
pilot a cost-effective way to survey beneficiaries’ satisfaction with project services. 
ROLL will regularly collect more in-depth opinions from target communities through 
interviews and focus groups during field visits, midterm and completion surveys. 
Grievance redress 
44.  The project will set up a grievance mechanism in responding to IFAD requirements 
while also sensitive to any pre-existing mechanisms. Affected populations will be 
made aware of the existence of these mechanisms through the scoping and 
mobilization exercise, and as part of the regular client feedback provision. The PMU 
12 See Framework for Operational Feedback from Stakeholders for further details. 
9 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
will maintain a register of grievances received, actions identified, and the status 
monitored by the PSC. 
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communication 
45.  Project planning will be conducted in close collaboration with key stakeholders at 
national; district and village level. Planning and budgeting will be integrated in the 
government's processes and based on the AWP/B. The ROLL logical framework will 
guide the development of the AWP/B reporting and monitoring system. ROLL 
logframe indicators are aligned with Lesotho’s 2020–2025 COSOP results 
framework.  
46.  The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit at PMU level will be responsible for M&E 
activities. Capacity-building on M&E will include: (i) in-depth training for the ROLL 
M&E officer through the Program in Rural M&E (PRiME); (ii) training for all PMU 
staff on planning, budgeting and use of M&E information; (iii) training of all staff 
with data input responsibilities on the use of the management information system; 
(iv) training on participatory planning and approaches for implementing partners 
and community coalition facilitators; (v) mainstreaming of participatory M&E in 
capacity-building of groups supported by the project. 
47.  Knowledge management (KM) is crucial to sustainably changing natural resource 
management patterns. ROLL’s KM strategy will aim at: (i) promoting behavioural 
change; (ii) developing policy-relevant knowledge products; and (iii) ensuring 
visibility. A KM and communication strategy will be developed with relevant 
ministries and implementing institutions, including the National University of 
Lesotho. 
Innovation and scaling up 
48.  ROLL introduces two major innovations: (i) the landscape graduation model; and 
(ii) the implementation modality through a facility and a fund. The latter will 
provide a dedicated window to foster research and innovation. Combining 
innovations and tech-supported interventions with knowledge management is 
another innovation of the project. Prospects for scaling up include the broader 
adoption of the graduation methodology and the mobilization of cofinancing for 
ROF. 
C.  Implementation plans 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
49.  Project implementation is due to start in November 2021. To ensure 
implementation readiness, a comprehensive draft PIM has been prepared, including 
a first draft of the AWP/B, a procurement plan and a list of terms of reference for 
service providers. The time between project design and start-up will be used to 
work on the establishment of the ROF and other preparatory and baseline studies. 
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans 
50.  Standard IFAD procedures for project supervision will be used to cover relevant 
aspects of project implementation, including Social, Environmental and Climate 
Assessment Procedures requirements, annual supervision missions and continuous 
engagement from the IFAD regional office and consultants. A joint midterm review 
will be carried out in the fourth project year and a completion report compliant with 
IFAD requirements by the end of the project. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
51.  A project financing agreement between the Kingdom of Lesotho and IFAD will 
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as 
appendix I. 
10 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
52.  The Kingdom of Lesotho is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 
IFAD. Further ratification is not required. 
53. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
VI.  Recommendation 
54. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms 
to the Kingdom of Lesotho in an amount of three million one hundred and 
forty thousand euro (EUR 3,140,000), equivalent to US$3,730,000 and upon 
such terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the 
terms and conditions presented herein. 
RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a loan on blend terms to 
the Kingdom of Lesotho in an amount of six million three hundred and sixty 
thousand euro (EUR 6,360,000), equivalent to US$7,570,000 and upon such 
terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms 
and conditions presented herein.

Schedule 1 
Programme Description and Implementation Arrangements 
I. 
Programme Description 
1. 
Target Population. The Project shall directly benefit 100,000 people, corresponding to 
approximately 68,000 rural households. The primary target group will be vulnerable rural 
households who live in selected catchment areas. This will comprise small-scale producers 
including  poor  smallholder  farmers,  livestock  owners  and  herders,  together  with 
unemployed youth and wage labourers. 
2. 
Project  area. The  Project  will  work  in  landscapes  defined  as  smaller  areas  within  a 
sub-catchment directly associated with and used by a village or a cluster of villages. Those 
landscapes can include a variety of different natural resource areas, such as grazing/range 
areas,  forests,  croplands,  wetlands  and  conservation  areas.    A  list  of  19  areas  directly 
associated  with  villages  within  16  sub-catchments  in  5  districts  of  Lesotho  have  been 
selected for project start-up. Expansion of the list of sub-catchments can be pursued within 
the lifetime of the project. (The “Project/Area”).  
Goal.  Human  interaction  with  the  natural  environment  is  the  primary  cause  of 
3. 
environmental  degradation  in  Lesotho,  exacerbated  by  climate  change.  In  turn, 
environmental degradation and low productivity lead to increased poverty, poor nutrition 
outcomes  and  vulnerability  to  climate  change.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  change  the 
dynamic of human interaction with their natural environment and reverse the environmental 
degradation that has been occasioned due to over exploitation of natural resources.  ROLL 
therefore  aims  to  promote  both  more  sustainable  resource  use  practices  and  diversified 
income opportunities. 
4.  Objectives. The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  ensure  that  rural  communities  adopt 
transformational practices for regenerated landscapes and sustainable livelihoods leading 
to improved nutrition and adaptation to climate change. This objective is underpinned by 
four  outcomes;  1)  change  in  resource  use  practices;  2)  reduction  of  environmental 
degradation; 3) improved livelihoods; and 4) the  establishment of a facility and a fund. 
The duration of the project is eight years. 
5. 
Components. The Programme shall consist of the following Components:  
5.1  Component A: Regeneration Coalition Facility 
In this component, different interest groups in a landscape are brought together under the 
umbrella  of  a  landscape  coalition.    The  objective  of  this  component  is  to  promote 
meaningful  change  by  promoting  a  common  understanding  on  the  causes  of  landscape 
degeneration and of the short and long-term threats that this presents to the livelihoods 
of  all  diverse  interest  groups  in  a  landscape  coalition.  Based  on  this  common 
understanding,  coalitions  will  identify  the  measures  needed  to  reverse  degradation, 
develop a shared commitment to establish more sustainable resource usage patterns and 
jointly  take  part  in  mobilizing  resources  from  the  Regeneration  Opportunities  Fund.  The 
component  will 
furthermore  entail  activities  geared  towards  technological  and 
organisational  innovation,  and  promote  nutrition  related  activities  within  the  selected 
landscapes.  
5.2  Component B: Regeneration Opportunities Fund  
The  Regeneration  Opportunities  Fund  (ROF)  has  the  objective  of  catalysing investments 
into the regeneration of landscapes. The Fund will be set up as an efficient and focused 
mechanism that can continue to function beyond the lifetime of the ROLL project. The ROF 
will  finance  coalition  plans  in  the  selected  landscapes.  In  doing  so,  the  ROF  will  serve 
multiple impact areas that have the potential to attract further capital seeking societal and 
5 
Appendix I 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
environmental benefits in terms of downstream water provision, biodiversity preservation 
and enhancement, and carbon sequestration.  
The ROF will be established in a phased approach. The first year will be used to finalize the 
design of the Fund's structure and governance arrangements, following the features and 
requirements  as  described  in  this  Agreement,  the  Project  Design  Report  and  associated 
documents. The process of design and implementation of the ROF will be overseen by a 
dedicated steering committee. The criteria for financial disbursements through the ROF will 
include the establishment of the governance bodies, the recruitment of a competent Fund 
Manager, an approved Investment Manual and a dedicated financial management system. 
The ROF has the aspiration to grow into a larger independent entity to channel investments 
in landscapes in Lesotho beyond the lifetime of the ROLL project. To facilitate this, the ROF 
will  require  a  robust  governance  and  oversight,  as  well  as  strong  results-based  delivery 
model, sound monitoring and skilled management.  
5.3  Component C: Project Management  
This  component  will  serve  to  facilitate  the  effective  and  efficient  implementation  of 
components A and B. It will also include the project’s monitoring and evaluation as well as 
the overall policy engagement and knowledge management functions. This component also 
includes the coordination of the innovation activities related to any co-financing the Project 
receives from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) investments and the partnership with 
FAO.  
II. 
Implementation Arrangements 
Lead  Programme  Agency. The  lead  programme  Agency  shall  be  the  Ministry  of 
6.  
Forestry, Range and Soil Conservation (MFRSC). 
7.   Programme Management Unit.  
The lead governance body for the project will be the Project Steering Committee (PSC), 
comprised of Directors and chaired by the Principal Secretary through the Director of Soil 
and Water Conservation, from the MFRSC. The other members of the PSC shall include but 
not  be  limited  to  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Forestry,  Range  and  Soil 
Conservation,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Food  Security,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of 
Water, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Local Government, Ministry of Gender, Youth 
&  Recreation.  It  shall  also  include  representatives  of  farmers  and  herders'  associations, 
NGOs, private sector and the civil society, and as observers LHDA, and ICM Unit.  
The  day-to-day  management  and  coordination  of  the  project  will  be  undertaken  by  a 
Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU will undertake the financial management and 
procurement of the Project. The PMU will be housed at the MFRSC and will be adequately 
staffed with professionals attracted from the market and seconded from the Government 
of the Kingdom of Lesotho (GoL). Selection of the PMU staff will be on competitive basis 
and  the  Fund  will  be  allowed  to  sit  as  observer  in  key  recruitments  as  necessary.  The 
principal  technical  partners  from  Government  will  include  the  Ministries  of  Tourism, 
Environment  and  Culture;  Agriculture  and  Food  Security;  Water;  Local  Government  and 
Chieftain  Affairs;  and  Gender,  Youth,  Sports  and  Recreation  among  others  as  may  be 
agreed upon from time to time.  
8. 
Implementing partners. The Projects other implementing partners are: 
(i)  Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS); 
(ii)  Ministry of Local Government and Chieftainship (MLGC);   
(iii)  Ministry of Energy and Meteorology;  
(iv)  Ministry of Water; 
(v)  Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture (MTEC); and 
6 
Appendix I 
EB 2021/LOT/P.4/Rev.1 
(vi)  The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) 
9.   Monitoring  and  Evaluation. ROLL  will  pay  high  priority  to  sound  monitoring  and 
impact measurement, as both will play a key role in establishing conducive environment 
for the ROF to graduate into and independent lasting funding mechanism. Project planning 
will  be  conducted  in  close  collaboration  with  key  stakeholders  at  national,  district  and 
village level through the Coalition process. Planning and budgeting will be integrated in the 
GoL  processes  and  will  be  based  on  Annual  Work  Plans  and  Budgets  (AWPBs).  The 
consolidated AWPB will be submitted to the PSC for review and approval and then sent to 
IFAD for review and No Objection at least 60 days before the start of the Programme year. 
A Management  Information System (MIS) will facilitate the storage, use and analysis of 
data. This system will, to the  extent possible, be connected to the national ICM dataset 
currently being established with the support of the ICM Support Project and GIZ/FAO. Data 
on outputs will be collected through the reports of implementing partners, validated by the 
PMU  and  triangulated  through  field  visits  by  the  PMU  M&E  unit.  Data  on  outcomes  and 
impact will be collected through a set of three surveys - baseline, mid-line and completion. 
M&E activities will be conducted as much as possible in a participatory way. This means 
that the communities themselves will set their own targets and monitor progress towards 
those targets. Tools such as participatory mapping, resource flow diagrams and outcome 
mapping  will  be  used.  Moreover,  a  system  will  be  set  up  for  regularly  collecting 
beneficiaries’  feedback  on  their  satisfaction  with  project  services  through  cost-effective, 
yearly WhatsApp surveys. 
10.   Knowledge  Management.  Knowledge  Management  and  communications  will  be 
closely linked to the policy engagement objectives, and aim at creating a broader societal 
awareness  of  the  existential  threat  to  households  and  communities  posed  by  landscape 
degradation.    Measures  will  be  introduced  to  raise  awareness  amongst  a  range  of 
stakeholders  including  local  councillors,  district  officials,  traditional  leaders,  decision 
makers at national level amongst others.  
11.   Project Implementation Manual. A comprehensive Project Implementation Manual will 
be prepared, together with an AWPB, procurement plan and Terms of reference for various 
service providers to be procured, and to ensure implementation readiness. Any revisions 
to the PIM and AWPB shall have to be previously approved by the Fund. 
12.  Project  Co-financing. The  Project  shall  be  capable  of  receiving  co-financing 
contributions  from  other  institutions  such  as  GEF  and  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International 
Development (OPEC Fund). The Project will also receive in kind contributions from FAO. 
The  Borrower  will  enter  into  co-financing  agreements  with  the  co-financiers  to  provide 
financing for the Project.

Integrated Project Risk Matrix 
Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Inherent  Residual 
Country Context 
Political Commitment 
Risk(s): 
The risk that an unstable political landscape can result in a lack of political 
will and commitment to the agriculture sector that lead to a potential reversal 
of key political decisions and withdrawal of support needed for the 
achievement of the project’s objectives (this includes programmed 
counterpart funding) 
Mitigations: 
●  Core responsibilities and clear stakeholder roles will be included in the 
loan agreements/IFAD 
●  Establishment of the Regeneration Opportunities Fund to attract 
additional financing from external investors 
Governance 
Risk(s):  
The risk that elite capture of project benefit streams can divert resources 
and thereby reduce the project effectiveness and affect the achievement of 
objectives 
Mitigations:  
●  Design and implement strong targeting policy and practices; delivery-
focused implementation mechanism/IFAD and PMU/ All years of project 
implementation  
●  Ensure transparent process of allocation of rewards and 
incentives/IFAD and PMU/ All years of project implementation 
●  Ring-fencing of select activities (e.g. bring in service provider)/PMU/ All 
years of project implementation 
●  Implementation of graduation methodology/PMU/ All years of project 
implementation 
Risk(s): 
The risk that political interference with area selection process which leads to 
the diversion of project resources to landscapes less in need of support 
leading to their sub-optimal allocation, compromising the project 
effectiveness and achievement of objectives 
Mitigations: 
Evidence-based area selection processes/IFAD and MFRSC/ All years of 
project implementation 
Risk(s): 
Given that Lesotho is ranked 85 out of 180 countries according to the 2019 
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) by Transparency International there is a 
risk that corrupt practices lead to a diversion of funds and/or benefit streams 
which compromises the achievement of objectives 
Mitigations: 
●  Evidence-based area selection processes/IFAD and MFRSC/ All years 
of project implementation  
●  Engagement of the internal audit (IA) unit within the ministry to carry out 
annual review of the systems of the PCU and all implementing 
agencies/ MFRSC/ All years of project implementation 
Macroeconomic

the Government of Lesotho and thus restrict ability to meet co-financing 
targets 
Mitigations: 
Allowing core activities and proof of concept at smaller scales and 
regardless of government co-financing 
Fragility and security 
Risk(s): 
The risk that Lesotho is vulnerable to natural and man-made shocks 
including civil unrest, conflict, and/or weak governance structures and 
institutions given the ‘elevated warning’ issued for Lesotho by the Fund For 
Peace in the Fragile State Index 2019 and the inclusion of the country in the 
list of ‘States of Fragility 2020’ by the OECD 
Mitigations: 
Project design gave strong focus at community and coalition level. This 
ideally protects against some risk of project blockage due to unrest in the 
capital. However, residual risk remains substantial in a context of relatively 
centralise governance structures 
Sector Strategies and Policies 
Policy alignment 
Risk(s): 
No risk envisaged 
Policy development & implementation 
Risk(s):  
The risk that the weak regulatory framework and current policy reforms 
under way (e.g. rangeland management act, forestry and land act) that 
complement project activities through sanctions can be contradicting and/or 
create loopholes that can compromise incentives of targeted communities to 
engage in project activities 
Mitigations:  
Supporting government to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks/IFAD/ 
All years of project implementation 
Environment and Climate Context  
Project vulnerability to environmental conditions 
Risk(s):  
Project areas and population living there are vulnerable to land degradation 
which is aggravated by extreme weather events (drought and floods). The 
current practices of overgrazing also exacerbate land/pasture degradation 
resulting in soil erosion, siltation of water bodies and destruction of 
biodiversity 
Mitigations:  
●  The SECAP annex and the preliminary ESMF included in the project 
design document identifies actions to reduce pressure on the natural 
resources and improve landscapes 
●  Project activities are directed to improving landscapes, mitigating 
effects of degradation and climatic change 
Project vulnerability to climate change impacts 
Risk(s):  
The risk that existing or possible future climate variability and/or extreme 
climatic events (e.g. droughts, heavy storms etc.) may further exacerbate 
land degradation and change the needs of targeted areas

●  A climate risk analysis included in the project design report will help 
minimise the identified risks 
●  Wide array of project activities including the graduation methodology 
are geared to counter degradation and increase resilience against the 
impacts of climate change 
Project Scope 
Project relevance  
Risk(s):  
The risk that the objectives and interventions of the project are not well 
aligned with national development or IFAD priorities, and/or are not 
sufficiently relevant or responsive to the needs and priorities of the intended 
target group throughout the project’s lifespan 
Mitigations:  
Strong stakeholder consultation and involvement of government in design 
process/ IFAD and MFRSC/ within project design process 
Technical soundness  
Risk(s):  
The risk that the setup of the legal entity to manage the Fund may incur 
delays that reduce ability to achieve project targets 
Mitigations: 
Ensure strong buy-in and oversight of process, set intermediate 
milestones/MFSRC and IFAD / All years of project implementation 
Risk(s): 
The risk that spreading project resources across 5 districts implies 
insufficient support to enable graduation of villages in selected landscapes 
and thus decrease effectiveness of the project 
Mitigations: 
●  Pilot of project interventions in selected areas of targeted districts 
before scaling up/ PCU/ within 1st year of project implementation 
●  Coalition facilitator to ensure continuity of activity/ PCU/ All years of 
project implementation 
Risk(s): 
The risk that communities do not understand or accept the project 
interventions leading to a low participation in project activities and thus 
undermining the project implementation and achievement of objectives 
Mitigations:  
●  Develop clear implementation and communication guidelines and 
materials (KM activities)/ PCU/ 1st year of project implementation  
●  Constant support and appropriate incentives to raise and sustain 
interest/ PCU/ All years of project implementation

M&E arrangements 
Risk(s):  
The risk that the project executing agency’s M&E processes and systems 
are weak or inefficient, resulting in a limited ability to monitor, validate, 
analyse and communicate results, capture lessons, and adjust 
implementation to seize opportunities and take corrective actions in a timely 
manner 
Mitigations:  
Establish strong PMU (IFAD to indicate key staff)/IFAD and MFRSC/ 
December 2021 
Procurement13 
Legal and regulatory framework 
Risk(s):  
Due to the national procurement framework being under reform since 2018, 
the lack of national standard bidding documents, the insufficient 
procurement monitoring and, most importantly, the observed lack of 
capacity and general lack of experience with donor-funded procurement of 
the MFRSC, there is a risk that the Borrower’s regulatory and institutional 
capacity and practices prove to be inadequate for the MFRSC to conduct 
procurement in a manner that optimizes value for money and integrity 
Mitigations:  
●  Procurement under ROLL will follow IFAD’s project procurement 
framework, resulting in the full adoption of IFAD’s Project Procurement 
Guidelines and IFAD’s Procurement Handbook in lieu of the national 
procurement framework/ PMU/ All years of project implementation 
●  IFAD-funded projects in Lesotho will employ the full set of IFAD 
standard procurement documents (SPDs) (with the exclusion of SADP 
II, which uses World Bank templates)/ PMU/ All years of project 
implementation 
●  IFAD-funded projects in Lesotho will be set up onto the Contract 
Monitoring Tool (CMT) function of ICP/ IFAD/ within 2021 
Accountability and transparency 
Risk(s):  
The Country lacks publicly available information on the procurement 
complaints management, specifically concerning cases being heard and 
applicable procedures. While Lesotho presents a medium Country 
Corruption Perception Index Score (40/100), the local authority responsible 
for investigating corruption allegations is not independent from the 
government and no systematic debarment system is in place. Furthermore, 
there is an unclear relationship between the procurement units, the 
Procurement Policy and Advice Division (PPAD) and the Directorate on 
Corruption & Economic Offence (DCEO), which is Lesotho’s anti-corruption 
authority. The risk is that accountability, transparency and oversight 
arrangements could be inadequate to safeguard the integrity of project 
procurement and contract execution, leading to potential cases of 
misprocurement and unintended use of funds

Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Inherent  Residual 
Mitigations:  
●  The Revised IFAD Policy on Preventing Fraud and Corruption in its 
Activities and Operations shall apply to all projects, vendors and third 
parties, in addition to the relevant national anticorruption and fraud 
laws/ IFAD, MFRSC and PMU/ All years of project implementation 
●  Pursuant to the aforementioned Policy, IFAD has the right to sanction 
firms and individuals including by declaring them ineligible, either 
indefinitely or for a stated period of time, to participate to any IFAD-
financed and/or IFAD-managed activity or operation. IFAD also has the 
right to unilaterally recognize debarments by any of the International 
Financial Institutions that are members to the Agreement for Mutual 
Enforcement of Debarment Decisions if such debarments meet the 
requirements for mutual recognition under the Agreement for Mutual 
Enforcement of Debarment Decisions/ IFAD/ All years of project 
implementation 
●  IFAD can strongly encourage government through policy dialogue to 
accelerate the adoption of the Public Procurement Bill, 2018, which 
provides the establishment of an autonomous Public Procurement 
Authority tasked with debarring suppliers, contractors or consultants 
from participating in public procurement/ IFAD/ All years of project 
implementation 
Capability in public procurement 
Risk(s):  
The Procurement Unit of the MFRSC (PU) handles a low number of 
procurement activities (none of which involves works or consulting services) 
and lacks experience with donor-funded procurement, since the MFRSC 
has had no major donor-funded projects in the past five years, and the 
minor projects it led showed that procurement was managed directly by the 
donors. Consequently, the PU exhibited procurement processes of 
mediocre quality. There is a risk that the capacity of the MFRSC could not 
meet the standards required by IFAD, resulting in adverse impacts to the 
development outcomes of the Project 
Mitigations:  
●  IFAD will provide trainings on its project procurement framework and 
international procurement practice from the start-up phase of ROLL, to 
be attended by the PU, Tender Panel and Technical Units of the

showed that procurement methods for goods were not entirely consistent 
with IFAD Project Procurement Guidelines and that the PU lacked 
experience with procurement of works and services. Procurement planning, 
contract administration/management and record keeping were also found to 
be inaccurate. The observed shortcomings could result in the misuse of 
project funds or sub-optimal implementation of the project 
Mitigations:  
●  IFAD will provide capacity building in the form of specific trainings for 
the MFRSC’s staff and ROLL will engage a procurement TA, both in 
country and remotely/ IFAD/ All years of project implementation
