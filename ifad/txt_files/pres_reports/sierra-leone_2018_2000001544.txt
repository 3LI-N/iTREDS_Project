EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Sierra Leone for the Agriculture Value Chain
Development Project (AVDP), as contained in paragraph 45.
Proposed Loan and Debt Sustainability Framework Grant
to the Republic of Sierra Leone for the Agriculture Value
Chain Development Project (AVDP)
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
The Republic of Sierra Leone economy has grown substantially since the end of the
civil war in 2002, but it suffered two major shocks in 2014/2015 – the Ebola
epidemic and the collapse of iron ore prices, with GDP shrinking 21 per cent in
2015. However, economic growth resumed following new investments in mining,
agriculture and fisheries, registering GDP growth of 6.3 per cent in 2016 and
5.7 per cent in 2017. Agriculture, the largest sector in the economy, accounted for
59 per cent of GDP in 2016, 62 per cent of the labour force, and 22 per cent of
export earnings. Cash crops produced for export include cocoa and coffee, while
palm oil is produced for domestic consumption and some export.
2.
Sierra Leone’s population is around 7.4 million (40 per cent youth) and growing at
2.2 per cent annually. Poverty is widespread but is particularly acute and
concentrated in rural areas, where 59 per cent of the population lives. The rural
poverty headcount of over 66 per cent is double that of urban areas. Women and
youth are particularly vulnerable due to challenges associated with access to land,
skills and capital, as well as customs. About 59.7 per cent of rural households in
Sierra Leone are food insecure, compared with 25.1 per cent in urban areas.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
3.
4.
RB-COSOP
Agricultural development remains key to Sierra Leone’s economic development and
rural poverty reduction, and there is considerable untapped potential for increasing
the production and productivity of both staple and cash crops. The project will
focus on three crops: rice, cocoa and palm oil, though the largest share of the
budget will be devoted to rice production in inland valley swamps, consistent with
the Government of Sierra Leone priorities. The AVDP will promote crop
diversification to provide flexibility and choice to beneficiaries and support
improved nutrition.
The AVDP is aligned with the National Agricultural Transformation 2023
Programme, which is currently in development. The AVDP addresses two of the
three priority intervention areas, which are rice self-sufficiency and crop
diversification, notably for palm oil and cocoa. The project aligns with five of the
seven new strategic priorities: (priority 2) Increasing investment in rice production,
processing and marketing, (priority 3) Make youth and women catalysts for
agribusiness development and growth, (priority 4) Invest in catalytic technologies
such as agricultural mechanization, irrigation and water management,
(priority 6) Strengthen sustainable biodiversity management and conservation,
including forest and tree crops, (priority 7) Increase the production of other crops,
such as vegetables, to ensure diversification.
1
EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
5.
6.
The selection of value chains is consistent with government priorities and pro-poor
approaches to value chain development. The crop mixture addresses increased
availability of the dietary staple (rice), improved nutritional balance (vegetables)
and increased income from all crops.
The project development objective and approach are aligned with the two strategic
objectives of the Country Strategy Note 2017-2018, namely (i) improved
smallholder farmers’ access to technical skills and markets; and (ii) improved
access to finance for rural communities.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
7.
Due to widespread poverty, the AVDP will in principle be nationwide, though the
concentration and intensity of project interventions will depend on climatic and
agroecological conditions in each of the 16 districts of Sierra Leone.1 While rice and
palm oil are produced throughout the country, cocoa production is localized in
specific districts.
8.
The socio-economic profile of the target group will be similar to that of the groups
targeted under the Smallholder Commercialization Program - Global Agriculture
and Food Security Program (SCP-GAFSP), although primarily in other areas of the
country. The majority of the beneficiaries (62.3 per cent) have no education. Only
37.7 per cent of beneficiaries have some formal education, mostly primary or
secondary but very little post-secondary/tertiary. More female beneficiaries
(69.1 per cent) than their male counterparts (40.5 per cent) have no education.
The average monthly income of beneficiaries is at 468,795 leones. Radio and
mobile phones are popular assets that beneficiaries own, as indicated by
49.8 per cent and 41.8 per cent of respondents, respectively. Ownership of other
assets is insignificant. Fully 91 per cent of households experienced hunger in the
12 months prior to the survey, during which they had difficulty providing sufficient
food to feed all members.
9.
The project is estimated to target 204,000 direct beneficiaries, equivalent to
34,000 households, over a period of six years, providing assistance to the target
groups and support for greater participation in targeted value chains. The project
aims at reaching at least 40 per cent of both women and youth.
B. Project development objective
10. The project's development objective is to increase the income of smallholder
farmers through the promotion of agriculture as a business.
C. Components/outcomes
11. The project has three components: (i) Climate-resilient and smart agricultural
production; (ii) Agricultural market development; (iii) Project coordination and
management.
12. Component 1: Climate-resilient and smart-agricultural production. The expected
outcome of component 1 is that the volume and value of production is increased
and production systems are made more climate resilient. Component 1 will have
two subcomponents, as follows:
(a) Subcomponent 1.1. Support for smallholder rice production and productivity.
This will support a total of 10,000 rice farmers by providing technical
assistance through farmer field schools and financial support for the
development of inland valley swamps for double or triple cropping of rice and
improved access to quality inputs and mechanized farming services.
1 The project will pursue a strategy of territorial concentration of interventions to facilitate implementation, which in
practice may mean that not all districts are targeted.
2
EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
(b) Subcomponent 1.2. Support for tree crop production and productivity. This
will involve work with 13,000 farmers (5,000 cocoa and 8,000 palm oil
producers) receiving technical assistance and support for the establishment of
one-hectare plots on fallow or abandoned agricultural land. No deforestation
is permitted to clear land for the smallholder plantations. No large plantations
will be supported.
13. Component 2: Agricultural market development. The expected outcome of this
component is improved performance and organization of the selected value chains
for increased smallholder production and productivity. The component is composed
of two subcomponents:
(a) Subcomponent 2.1. Market access. This subcomponent will focus on:
strengthening the business skills of Agri-Business Centres, farmers’
organizations; farmer field schools; facilitating value chain organizations; and
deal making through the establishment of provincial multi-stakeholder
platforms.
(b) Subcomponent 2.2. Climate-resilient rural infrastructure. Partly financed
through the Adaptation Fund, this will involve the rehabilitation of
warehouses to improve product drying and storage capacity, provide potable
water and latrines and rehabilitate feeder roads and farm tracks.
14. Component 3: Project coordination and management. This component is divided
into two subcomponents:
(a) Subcomponent 3.1. Project coordination and management.
(b) Subcomponent 3.2. Financing mechanisms for target groups.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
15. The overall AVDP approach will be market-centred and demand-driven. The main
thrust will be on establishing win-win partnerships between producers and their
organizations, private-sector agribusinesses and rural finance institutions. This will
be achieved through a series of activities, including the provision of technical
assistance by the farmer field schools, as well as the strengthening of farmers’
organizations to better plan production and the purchase of inputs. The availability
of certified seeds will be enhanced through the set-up of seed multiplication plots
that will be linked to private-sector processors. The project will provide matching
grants to facilitate beneficiary investment in production infrastructure to boost
productivity. The matching grants scheme will also increase financial inclusion, as
most producers’ groups will need credit for their investments. Multi-stakeholder
platforms will better integrate the value chains by bringing the different
stakeholders – including representatives of the smallholder farmers – to the table
to find solutions to current obstacles, build trust and facilitate business deals.
Rehabilitated feeder roads will further facilitate market linkages. Additionally, the
project will seek to climate proof the productive investments and ensure relevant
capacity-building.
B. Organizational framework
16. The National Programme Coordination Unit (NPCU) will be responsible for project
planning, financial management, contracting implementing partners for specific
activities and tasks, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), communication and
knowledge management, supervision of project activities at the district level and
facilitating linkage with the Government, private-sector and development
institutions and integrating project experience into policy dialogue.
3
EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
17. The NPCU will have approximately 25 technical and support staff at its
headquarters, supplemented with a robust presence at the provincial level with the
out-posting of 4 tree crop officers, 4 inland valley swamp officers, 2 agribusiness
specialists and 4 Community Mobilizers/Targeting Specialists. A matching grant
evaluation committee will be set up to approve grant applications. Staff
implementing AVDP will have an opportunity for training to improve their
performance. At the district level, the district agricultural officer of Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS) will be responsible for
coordinating the implementation of project activities.
18. AVDP will be placed under the technical supervision of the MAFFS. The MAFFS and
the National Steering Committee will provide oversight, direction and advice for
project implementation, and in particular, approve the project’s Annual Work Plan
and Budget (AWPB), as well as its periodic progress reports.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation and learning and
knowledge management
19. The project will prepare an AWPB for approval by the National Steering Committee
and subsequent presentation to IFAD for no objection. The AWPB will serve as the
basis for any work that the project undertakes. The AWPB will be prepared in
consultation with beneficiaries and other stakeholders and build on the project’s
progress.
20. The project’s logical framework will be the main document for supporting results-
based and objective-oriented implementation. The AVDP monitoring and evaluation
system will build on the system developed in the SCP-GAFSP, including its M&E
manual. The M&E system will be in line with the Government of Sierra Leone
requirements, as well as IFAD’s Operational Results Management System and will
generate gender- and age-disaggregated data on project outputs, outcomes and
impacts.
21. AVDP monitoring will be integrated into the existing SCP-GAFSP monitoring and
evaluation framework. The project M&E Unit will include and regularly assess a
number of gender, youth and other group-specific indicators in the programme’s
M&E system at the output, outcome and impact level-in particular, capturing the
improvement of access to outputs, their use by the target groups and these
groups’ satisfaction with them.
22. Knowledge management and learning are key to meeting project objectives, as
reliable information is the basis of results-based management. Priority will be given
to areas where AVDP interventions are recognized as exemplary and expected to
have the greatest impact, though failures are also an important basis for learning.
Best practices and proven concepts will be fed into the MAFFS and regional
knowledge management systems. Lessons learned will also be fed into the
continuous improvement of manuals, concepts and strategies and disseminated to
the various target groups, including the public, using appropriate communication
media.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
23. The inherent risk is assessed as high. As a result, the project will largely follow the
financial management arrangements already established under the ongoing IFAD
projects, which will lower the risk to medium. The financial management
arrangements will include the following: (i) a qualified financial controller and an
accountant will be appointed; (ii) all programme transactions will be recorded in
customized accounting software, in accordance with the International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) cash-basis of accounting, (iii) a designated account
in United States dollars for IFAD financing will be maintained at a commercial bank,
and IFAD funds will not be mingled with other funds, (iv) IFAD financing will be
disbursed in accordance with IFAD disbursement procedures and (v) the NPCU will
4
EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
prepare quarterly financial reports in formats agreed upon with IFAD. Furthermore,
the consolidated financial statements will be audited annually by the Audit Service
of Sierra Leone – Office of the Auditor General, in accordance with International
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions/International Standards of Supreme
Audit Institutions (INTOSAI/ISSAI) standards and IFAD audit requirements. The
audit report, together with the management letter, will be submitted to IFAD within
six months of the end of the fiscal year. The day-to-day financial operations will be
specified further in the relevant section of the project implementation manual.
24.
IFAD’s has a zero-tolerance policy toward fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive
actions in all projects financed through its loans and grants. IFAD's anticorruption
policy and whistleblowing procedures will be mainstreamed in the project
implementation manual.
25. A procurement assessment was undertaken as part of the design mission.
According to the assessment, the legal and regulatory framework for public
procurement in Sierra Leone will be used for all AVDP procurement activities, with
the exception of international competitive bidding, for which the World Bank
guidelines and framework will apply. In addition, the procurement plan to be used
by AVDP will be based on the version presented as part of the IFAD Project
Procurement Handbook.
E. Supervision
26. The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. Supervision will be conducted as an
opportunity to assess achievements and lessons jointly and reflect on ways to
improve implementation and impact. Furthermore, a financial management
specialist will participate in missions at least annually to supervise and provide
implementation support to the project and monitor the fiduciary risk at various
levels.
IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
27. The financing gap of US$28.5 million may be sourced by subsequent performance-
based allocation system (PBAS) cycles (under financing terms to be determined
and subject to internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval) or by
cofinancing identified during implementation.
A. Project costs
28. The total combined AVDP investment and incremental recurrent costs, including
physical and price contingencies, are estimated at US$60.3 million, disaggregated
by component as follows: component 1, climate-resilient and smart-agricultural
production, is the main investment component, representing US$37.9 million of the
total project costs (63 per cent of total costs); while component 2, agricultural
market development, accounts for US$13.4 million (22 per cent of total costs); and
US$9 million for the project coordination and management component 3,
(15 per cent of total project costs).

B. Project financing
29. The financing plan covers: (i) IFAD financing of US$11.8 million under the
Tenth Replenishment of IFAD's Resources (IFAD10); (ii) a financing gap of
US$28.5 million, which may be sourced by subsequent PBAS cycles, as outlined in
paragraph 27; (iii) an Adaptation Fund grant of US$9.2 million, subject to
approval; (iv) a contribution from the Government of US$8.1 million, which will be
used to finance project duties and VAT, of which US$1.9 million will be provided to
match IFAD financing of US$11.8 million approved under IFAD10; (v) estimated
beneficiary contributions (in-kind and cash) of US$1.4 million; and (vi) a private-
sector contribution of US$1.4 million.
30. Additionally, the AVDP is expected to benefit from an estimated US$10 million in
parallel value chain investments under the World Bank-financed Smallholder
Commercialization and Agribusiness Development Project and an estimated
US$12 million for the rice-seed value chain under the World Bank’s West Africa
Agricultural Transformation Project.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
31. The economic analysis shows that the project has the capacity to generate an
economic rate of return (ERR) of 32 per cent over a 20-year period, with a net
present value of Sierra Leonean leone 203 billion (approximately US$23.5 million).
Given the many unquantifiable benefits, the actual ERR will likely be higher.
32.
In order to test the robustness of the above results, sensitivity analysis was carried
out, and the results are presented below. The sensitivity analysis investigates the
effect of fluctuations in project costs, benefits and implementation delays on the
net present value and ERR. The results show that the ERR drops to 22 per cent
with a 20 per cent increase in costs, and to 20 per cent with a 50 per cent increase
in costs, still making the project economically viable.
D. Sustainability
33. The project aims at strengthening farmers’ organizations to the extent that they
are able to collectively plan sustainable production, purchase inputs and sell their
produce through stable private-sector engagement. In coordination with the Rural
Finance and Community Improvement Programme, the project also seeks to
ensure that farmer-based organizations are sustainably accessing rural finance for
inputs. Furthermore, productive investments will be climate proofed through the
financing from the Adaptation Fund. Finally, through policy engagement planned as
part of component 3, the project will help keep the Government's focus on the
rural poor and facilitate Government support to the target group after project
completion.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
34. Since governance issues could compromise the expected impact on communities
and increase project costs, the risk is classified as high. Elite capture of outputs,
especially physical assets, which are intended for well-defined target groups, is
another problem associated with poor governance. These governance risks will be
mitigated by complementing the Government’s initiatives with: (i) increased
transparency and publicity about the distribution of outputs; (ii) training for
7
EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
implementers at all levels in financial management, procurement, M&E and
reporting procedures; (iii) the implementation of a clear targeting strategy; and
(iv) continued improvement of the grievance mechanism for beneficiaries. The
Good Governance Framework developed for the SCP-GAFSP will be applied during
the implementation of AVDP.
35.
Institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability risks are considered
moderate. Failure in project coordination is a risk, especially among and within
non-state actors and private agribusiness. Private stakeholders consistently
indicate that institutions that provide critical support services to private-sector
investors remain weak and coordination among them is fragmented. The project
will mitigate this risk by ensuring that the project implementation unit has clear
mechanisms for effective coordination during project implementation.
36. The AVDP is not expected to have overall negative environmental impacts.
However, since small commercial agricultural activities may produce unexpected
cumulative impacts, careful design of an appropriate monitoring system is critical.
The major concerns are associated with the increased use of fertilizers and
pesticides that might result from wider distribution of these products and their
impact on biodiversity and human health. Training on proper use and disposal,
adoption of the principles of the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution
and Use of Pesticides of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
Nations, as well as the design of an environmental monitoring system in
partnership with the Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Agency are considered
sufficient mitigation measures. Based on the above information, the project has
been classified as category B according to IFAD classification standards.
37. The promotion of palm oil is considered to entail limited risks, as only smallholder
oil palm plantations of a maximum of one hectare will be established under the
project. Large-scale plantations will not be supported. Furthermore, new
smallholder plantations will be established only on fallow or abandoned agricultural
land, and no deforestation will be accepted. Moreover, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis)
is endemic to West Africa and is therefore a natural part of the vegetation in
Sierra Leone. The palm oil produced will largely be used for cooking and sold on
the domestic market. Appendix II presents answers to key questions on how the
project will support palm oil production.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
38. The project is aligned with the IFAD11 priorities on a range of parameters. First, it
addresses gender, youth, nutrition and climate change and therefore supports the
IFAD11 mainstreaming agenda. Second, the project has managed to attract
cofinancing from the Adaptation Fund and will therefore contribute to the corporate
cofinancing targets. Third, the project is designed to have a relatively frontloaded
disbursement profile underpinned by substantial investments in equipment and
irrigation systems, as well as road rehabilitation and maintenance in the initial
years, all of which will contribute to an increasing corporate disbursement ratio.
Fourth, the project covers two PBAS cycles and is therefore aligned with the notion
of delivering bigger, better and smarter.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
39. The AVDP is wholly consistent with the Government’s National Agricultural
Transformation 2023 Programme, which is currently in development. The AVDP
addresses two of the three priority intervention areas, which are rice self-
sufficiency and crop diversification, notably for palm oil and cocoa. The selection of
value chains will allow the AVDP to build on and strengthen the results that have
been achieved in Sierra Leone through past and ongoing IFAD-financed projects
operating in the same value chains.
8
EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
Innovations and scaling up
C.
40. The project scales up and refines the intervention model developed under the
ongoing SCP-GAFSP, but with a range of innovations, including: (i) the
establishment of multi-stakeholder platforms to strengthen integration of the
selected sustainable value chains; and (ii) an increased focus on nutrition and food
security through the promotion of intercropping with food/tree crops and the
creation of vegetable gardens.
D.
41.
Policy engagement
Policy engagement in the interest of smallholder farmers and the rural poor will be
undertaken through: (i) the organization of periodic stakeholder discussions around
specific policy issues, with the participation of public and private value chain
stakeholders; (ii) the use of provincial commodity platforms as a nexus for
discussing and sharing policy-related concerns with the Government, in line with
national priorities; (iii) support for relevant analytical work related to agricultural
policies and strategies; and (iv) support for capacity-building in selected
government agencies involved in policy-making for agricultural development
(e.g., MAFFS, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development
and Ministry of Trade and Industry).
VI. Legal instruments and authority
42. A financing agreement between the Republic of Sierra Leone and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.
43. The Republic of Sierra Leone is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.
44.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
45.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
the Republic of Sierra Leone in an amount of five million nine hundred
thousand United States dollars (US$5,900,000) and upon such terms and
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.
RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a DSF grant to the
Republic of Sierra Leone in an amount of five million nine hundred thousand

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements
I.
Project Description
Goal.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  the  improvement  of  the  livelihoods,  food  security
1.
and climate change resilience of rural farming households in Sierra Leone.
Objectives.  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  increase  incomes  for smallholder
2.
farmers through the promotion of agriculture as a business.
3.
Target Population. The Project shall benefit about 34,000 direct beneficiaries in the
16 districts of the country (the “Project Area”) and focus activities where the climatic and
agro-ecological conditions are favourable for smallholders to produce cocoa, oil palm and
rice. The primary target group will be smallholder producers of cocoa, rice and oil palm.
Additionally,  the  project  will  target  (a)  farmer-based  organized  institutions  such  as
Agribusiness  Centres 
cooperatives;  and
(b) institutions  providing  services  or  inputs  such  as  input  suppliers,  agro-dealers,
agents/middlemen,  and  processors  as  well  as  buyers/exporters.  Over  the  life  of  the
Project,  AVDP  interventions  will include  at  least  40%  women  and  40%  youths,  and  will
employ mechanisms that promote gender equality and social inclusion.
(ABCs),  Farmer  Organizations  and 
4.
Components. The Project shall consist of the following Components:
Component 1.
4.1.
Climate Resilient  and  Smart  Agricultural Production.
The  outcome  of this component is that volume and value of production is increased, and
production  systems  are  made  more  climate  resilient.  The  component  will  support  the
preparation  of  Business  Development  Plans at  the  level  of  the  ABCs  that  will  include  a
comprehensive  plan  of  the  investments  needed  to  develop  the  productive  capacities  of
rice, cocoa or oil palm. All investments will be assessed for their social and environmental
impact  through  Environment  and  Social  Management  Plans. Capacity  building  for
improved  production  techniques  and  extension  will  be  provided  using  the  Farmer  Field
School (FFS) methodology.
4.1.1 Sub-Component 1.1.
Support to smallholder rice production and productivity,
will  work  with  5,000  rice  farmers  who  have  not  previously  benefited  from  the
SCP/GAFSP  Project,  to  provide  technical  assistance  through  Farmer  Field  Schools
and  financial  support  for  the  development  of  inland  valley  swamps  for  double  or
triple  cropping  of rice,  and  improved  access  to  quality  inputs  and  mechanized
farming services. The Project will help Farmers’ Organizations and ABCs mentioned
above add value to paddy by improving milling capacity and quality and facilitating
market  linkages  with  off-takers.  The  Project  will  similarly  provide  technical
assistance and training to 5,000 legacy rice farmers that have benefitted from past
projects.
4.1.2. Sub-Component 1.2.
Support  to  tree  crop  production  and  productivity,  will
work  with  9,000  farmers  (5,000 cacao  and  4,000  oil  palm  producers)  each
receiving support for the establishment of a one-hectare plot, who were not direct
beneficiaries  of  the  SCP/GAFSP Project.  The  subcomponent  will  enhance  the
economic  viability  and  climate  resilience  of  oil  palm  and cocoa  farmers  and  link
them  more  effectively  to  private  sector  markets.  The  AVDP  will  also  continue  to
provide  technical  assistance  and  training  for  4,000  legacy  oil  palm  farmers  who
received assistance under past projects.
4
Appendix I
EB/2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1
Replanting  and  new  planting  of cocoa  sites  will  be  supported  partially  by  the
Adaption  Fund  with  provision  of  climate  resilient  hybrid  seeds  provided  by  the
rejuvenated  clonal  garden  of  the  Sierra  Leone  Agricultural  Research  Institute
(SLARI).  The  AVDP  will  provide  technical  and  support for  the  establishment  of
community nurseries to outgrow the seedlings obtained from SLARI. The replanted
or new plantations will intercrop plantains, cassava, and/or timber trees for shade
provision and supplementary income generation.
For oil palm, AVDP will procure improved tenera variety seeds from regional private
sector  suppliers  and  establish  community  nurseries.  AVDP  will  assist  farmers  to
carry out intercropping with food crops (e.g. groundnuts and rice) during the initial
growth of infant trees to improve livelihoods and household nutrition. AVDP will not
support  the  clearing  of  forest  areas  for  tree  crop  plantations.  Rather  degraded
secondary bush areas will be used for such plantings.
Component 2.
4.2.
Agricultural  Market  Development, contains  two  sub-
components: (i) Market access and (ii) Climate resilient rural infrastructure. The expected
outcome of this component is the improved performance and organization of the selected
value chains for increased smallholder production and productivity.
4.2.1. Sub-component 2.1
Market Access, will focus on strengthening the business
skills of ABCs, Farmer Organizations and Farmer Field Schools and facilitating value
chain  organization  and  deal  making  through  the  establishment  of  provincial  level
multi-stakeholder  platforms.  Key  activities  under  this  sub-component  include
mapping of existing value chain players, including farmer-based organisations, and
the  provision  of  capacity  building  according  to  their  needs;  through  the  multi-
stakeholder platforms, the project will facilitate linkages and deal making between
AVDP  beneficiary  organizations,  input  suppliers,  aggregators  and  large  scale
processors and commodity buyers.
4.2.2
Sub-component 2.2.
Climate  Resilient  Rural  Infrastructure,  financed  mainly through
the  Adaption  Fund,  will  rehabilitate  20  warehouses  to  improve  product  drying  and  storage
capacity, as well as construct and rehabilitate secondary roads and farm tracks. The AVDP will
use a labor-based approach to road improvement, employing local residents for certain tasks,
thereby  generating  temporary  employment  opportunities.  The  sub-component  will  also
finance improved water supply and sanitation among other activities.
Component 3.
4.3.
The
implementation  of  AVDP  will  be  anchored  within  the National  Project  Coordination  Unit
(NPCU) and  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  at  the  district  level.  Staffing  levels  at
NPCU will be complemented as needed.

Palm oil production under AVDP: Questions and answers
Q1:  What  type  of  oil  palm  producers  and  plantations  will  benefit  from  the
AVDP?
Answer: The  project  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of  small  plots  of  oil  palm
(maximum  1  ha  per  plot)  for  approximately  4,000  smallholder  producers.  No
large plantations will be established.
Q2:  Will  the  establishment  of  any  new  oil  palm  plantation result 
deforestation?
in
Answer: No  deforestation  will  take  place  as  a  result  of  the  project.  The  new
smallholder oil palm plantations will be established on fallow lands or abandoned
agricultural  lands  only.  This  is  expected  to  increase  the  carbon  sequestration  of
the territory.
Q3: Will the establishment of any new oil palm plantation result in involuntary
resettlement of project beneficiaries?
Answer: Plantations will be established on family lands by beneficiaries with title
to  the  lands  under  the  existing  traditional  land  tenure  system. No  resettlement,
neither voluntary nor involuntary, is foreseen under the project.
Q4: What is the foreseen market for the oil palm produced under the project?
Answer: The vast majority of the oil palm produced as a result of the project is
expected to be  sold on domestic markets as  oil palm is widely used for cooking.
National production have reduced drastically as a result of  neglected plantations
since  the  civil  was  (1991-2002).  The  small-scale  traditional  system relies  mainly
on wild plants for production which caters for domestic markets and neighbouring
countries.
Q5:  Has  IFAD-funded  projects  supported  oil  palm  production  in  the  past  in
Sierra Leone?
IFAD 
The  ongoing 
supervised  project, 
Answer:
  Smallholder
Commercialisation  Programme  financed  by  the  Global  Agricultural    and  Food
Security  Programme  (SCP-GAFSP)  has  a  tree  crop  component  that  provides
supports  for the establishment of 3,000 hectares of high yielding tenera oil palm
plantation  for  a  total  of 3,000  beneficiaries.    The  proposed  approach  to  oil  palm
production  under  AVDP  therefore  builds  on  the  practices  of  SCP  in  which  no
infringements of the social and environmental safeguards have been registered.
the 
Q6: Will the project  be  aligned to the new Roundtable  on Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO) standard for Smallholder Certification, Support and Inclusion?
Answer: The  proposed  new  RSPO  standard  for  smallholder  production  is
currently  for  public  consultation  and  therefore  has  not  been  finalised.  The
proposed  standard  is  however  very  aligned  with  how  oil  palm  is  currently

supported  under  the  SCP  and  will  be  promoted  under  the  AVDP.  The  draft
eligibility criteria for smallholder RSPO certification is as follows:2

V.
Individual  smallholder  group  members  can  demonstrate  they  have  the
legal or customary rights to use the land.
Farms/smallholdings  are  located  in  areas  that  are  outside  of  those
classified as a national park or protected area, as defined by national law.
In cases where there will be new plantings, smallholders commit that they
will  consult  with  indigenous  groups  and  local  communities,  where  the
consultation  process  is  appropriate  to local  conditions,  and  ensures  rights
and  interest  of  affected  parties  are  respected.  (Note,  exact  wording
pending  outcomes  of  ongoing  discussions  on  No  Deforestation  and  New
Planting Procedures (NPP) for smallholders).
Smallholders  commit  to  no  use  of  fire  in  preparing  for  re-planting  or  for
waste management.
Smallholders  commit  to  no  use  of  child  labour.  (The  minimum  age of
workers  as  defined  by  national  interpretation  or  law  is  respected,  and
children under the age of 18 do not carry out any work that is harmful to
the  health,  safety  or  morals  of  children,  e.g.  with  dangerous  substances,
spraying, heavy lifting, harvest). Additionally, in cases where children from
the  household  work  on  the  smallholder  farm,  this  is  restricted  to
afterschool  hours,  the  weekend  or  holidays  and  does  not  interfere  with
schooling or education.
Q7: In the context of post conflict country such as Sierra Leone, how IFAD will
ensure  that sustainability  and  strong  monitoring  of  environmental  and  social
safeguards during implementation is guaranteed by the project team?
Answer: As  part  of  project  start-up,  a  capacity-building  exercise  will  be
undertaken to ensure that the right capacities are in place to adequately monitor
the  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  This  capacity-building  will  not  only  be
targeted at project staff but also the service providers that will assist the farmers
in the establishment of the smallholder plantation. Additionally, the management
fee that IFAD will receive through the cofinancing by the Adaptation Fund will be
rigorously used for supervision of the application of the social and environmental
safeguards, namely the compliance with the SECAP procedures.
Q8:  In  the  preparation  of  the  SECAP,  which  has  provided  substantial  guidance
during the design and internal review process (the QE and QA reviews), did the
project team carry out social and environmental assessments of all project sites
such as the exact location of oil palm areas and related infrastructure?
Answer: Sub-project  sites  are  not  identified  a  priori  but  will  be  identified  in  a
demand-driven  manner  in  consultation  with  the  beneficiaries.  However, as
outlined  in  the  Project's Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF),  each  subproject  will  have  an Environment  and  Social  Management  Plan
(ESMP)  developed  alongside  its  business  plan.  The ESMF  with  the  outline  and
contents  of  the  ESMP  and  the  review  process  can  be  found  in appendix  8  of  the
Project Design Report.
