Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed 
additional financing to cover a financing gap, as outlined in paragraph 47. 
I.  Background and programme description 
A.  Background  
1. 
The present memorandum seeks approval for additional financing in the form of a 
loan in the amount of EUR 19.09 million on ordinary terms for the Uplands Rural 
Development Programme (URDP).  
2. 
3. 
4. 
The programme, with a total cost of EUR 98.14 million, was submitted to the 
Executive Board in December 2017 (EB 2017/122/R.26/Rev.1), and approved with 
a loan of EUR 35.15 million and a grant of EUR 0.90 million. Cofinancing for 
EUR 29.14 million was provided by the Government of Turkey (EUR 15.70 million), 
beneficiaries (EUR 10.94 million) and the Credit Guarantee Fund [Kredi Garanti 
Fonu] (KGF) (EUR 2.50 million). As the 2019-2021 cycle of the performance-based 
allocation system (PBAS) for Turkey was fully taken up at the time, this left a 
financing gap of EUR 32.95 million to be sourced from the subsequent PBAS 
allocation once available.  
The financing agreement for the first phase of the programme was signed by IFAD 
and the Republic of Turkey on 26 December 2017 and entered into force on 
5 March 2018, with a programme completion date of 31 March 2023 and a 
financing closing date of 30 September 2023.  
In order to fit the programme within the final country allocation available under the 
Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources, it has been downsized in close 
consultation with the Government by reducing the total programme costs to 
EUR 73.50 million. The objective of the requested additional financing is to close 
the remaining financing gap to ensure successful implementation. 
B.  Original programme description 
5. 
The overall goal of the programme is to enhance the prosperity and resilience of 
upland smallholder farmers. This is to be accomplished by strengthening economic 
opportunities for poor rural people, based on competitive farms and agribusinesses 
connected to and integrated into more profitable economic clusters, making 
sustainable use of Turkey’s natural resources. The core strategy is to build on and 
accentuate the valued characteristics of rural production, ensuring that sustainable 
land- and water-use practices are promoted, while also increasing the  
climate-adaptive capacity of smallholders. 
6. 
The strategy is geared to two complementary core outcomes. The first builds 
critical support for agribusiness development through better natural resource 
management and higher added value for rural transformation, using an economic 
clustering approach. The second seeks to improve smallholder access to financial 
services, leveraging private financial resources in the process. The two core 
outcomes have been chosen to achieve optimal impact in terms of addressing the 
core constraints facing poor smallholders in upland areas. The combined outcomes 
will thus deliver more than the sum of their parts by ensuring that a multiplicity of 
challenges are addressed simultaneously, where and when needed. Moreover, the 
outcomes also reflect the areas in which IFAD has a comparative advantage  
vis-à-vis other development partners, most notably in catalysing inclusive rural 
transformation for smallholders. The programme is slated for completion in 2025.

EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
II.  Rationale for additional financing  
A.  Rationale 
7. 
The URDP has the potential to bring a wealth of field experience to the policy 
discourse on clustering and rural youth and women’s agribusiness development in 
Turkey. Both IFAD and the Government perceive the URDP to be an important 
investment in countering increasing isolation, depopulation and inequality between 
rural and urban areas. Consequently, the learning and knowledge generated will 
contribute significantly to the design and implementation of agricultural 
interventions empowering youth within the agriculture sector as a whole.  
8. 
The Government has formally requested additional financing in the amount of the 
allocation under the current PBAS cycle to cover the financing gap of 
EUR 32.95 million, as foreseen at the time of the programme’s approval by the 
Executive Board in December 2017. As the current PBAS allocation of 
EUR 19 million falls short of covering the existing financing gap by 
EUR 13.9 million, the programme costs have been reduced to fit within the amount 
of financing available by reducing the programme outreach. The additional 
financing will enable the programme to ensure coverage of the full range of project 
activities. The approach taken to downsizing the programme to fit within the 
financing available was carefully selected to reduce outreach under each 
component based on the reduced envelope and the calculated cost per beneficiary, 
while preserving the full learning potential.  
9.  Most recently, the restrictions and other measures introduced to contain the 
COVID-19 pandemic are posing a renewed risk of further economic and social 
marginalization of rural areas. The programme will not only contribute to mitigating 
that risk but will also help identify policy recommendations to mitigate the impact 
of COVID-19 and accelerate recovery.  
10.  The programme was launched in March 2019. Start-up was delayed by a budget 
capping policy implemented by the Government to contain the economic crisis. 
With the completion of the reform, the establishment of 22 economic development 
clusters (EDCs), the finalization of 22 strategic investment plans and the initiation 
of the matching grant programme with 7,450 applications, the context is now 
conducive to take up implementation with a full financing package and at an 
accelerated pace to compensate for lost time.  
Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
11.  Gender. Constraints such as a lack of assets, capital and access to institutional 
credit, competing demands on time, poor technical skills and lack of access to 
extension services affect women more than men. The scant presence of women in 
formal institutions and organizations limits their ability to make their voices heard 
and influence decision-making. In line with the gender strategy, the programme 
will make use of a gender action plan to enable women to expand their economic 
and social empowerment. The action plan will include training on improved 
practices for better production and productivity, building financial and business 
skills to start up small businesses or income-generating activities, and providing 
assistance in accessing appropriate financial services. 
12.  Youth. At the national level, one of the major problems specific to youth is 
unemployment. In addition, youth in rural areas face even greater challenges with 
the dwindling numbers of attractive social facilities, including schools and cultural 
facilities, and limited value added in agriculture, discouraging them from investing 
their time and energy in the sector. For many, in particular young men, migration 
to major urban centres in search of informal employment is seen as an attractive 
alternative. To support rural youth employment, the programme will promote the 
involvement of young men and women along the various segments of the value 
chains: (i) in services such as transportation, distribution and labour employed in 
processing centres; and (ii) as producers, introducing through them a business-
2 
EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
oriented approach to production and marketing. Furthermore, given the higher 
presence of young women in rural areas and their involvement in agriculture, the 
programme will pay specific attention to them. 
13.  Climate. Temperatures have risen steadily in both of the programme provinces, 
with peak increases recorded during early summer and winter. Although the 
available rainfall has increased in most of the provinces, rainfall distribution during 
the year has changed. Soil erosion is a recurrent problem and is likely to worsen 
with increasing rainfall. The programme will improve resilience to shocks by 
supporting awareness-raising, training and climate-smart investments such as 
small-scale irrigation, vegetable production under cover (using plastic tunnels), 
contour ploughing and land consolidation by planting key agroforestry species. 
B.  Description of geographical area and target groups  
14.  The programme is being implemented in eight provinces in two regions: the 
eastern Mediterranean (Adana, Mersin, Osmaniye, Kahramanmaras) and the 
western Black Sea (Bartın, Kastamonu, Sinop, Çankırı), potentially covering 35 
districts and targeting 30,000 households during the first phase and 17,400 during 
the second phase, for a total outreach of 47,400 households.  
15.  The intervention focuses on upland and transitional areas, where farmland and 
pastures are mainly above 600 metres and where most forest villages are located. 
However, some villages located below 600 metres (between 400 metres and 600 
metres) may also be selected on the basis of topographic factors and 
characteristics similar to the upland villages (being particularly disadvantaged due 
to their location). 
16.  The URDP's focus is mainly on the economically active poor – those remaining in 
rural areas and having the potential to invest time, effort and capital and thus 
catalyse this transformation. Beneficiaries can be divided into three main target 
groups: (i) the economically active poor producing at semi-subsistence level; 
(ii) the economically active poor with upside potential; and (iii) transformation 
drivers (suppliers, traders or agribusinesses). The targeting strategy includes a mix 
of methods and approaches. Self-targeting is one of them, as many activities are of 
immediate relevance to economically active farmers (poor and better off) and other 
value chain actors, who have a genuine interest and motivation to participate in 
meetings and/or cluster activities. Targeted activities are also directed to women 
and youth – who will make up 30 per cent and 10 per cent of programme 
beneficiaries respectively – and to transhumant pastoralist households. 
C.  Components, outcomes and activities 
17.  Operationally, the two outcomes – (i) strengthened EDCs, and (ii) increased 
utilization of financial services among rural people in the uplands – have been 
translated into two concrete components: 
18.  Component 1: Clustering for resilient rural transformation. The EDC is the 
entry point for addressing local challenges in developing the main value chains. 
This component increases the volume of production and trade for agricultural 
products within each EDC, through individual investments and support to key 
economic infrastructure co-managed by the stakeholders. This increases the 
profitability of upland farming and agribusinesses and thus improves their appeal 
to young farmers remaining in these areas. It also delivers on cluster investment 
partnerships (CIPs) in which both private and public investments are leveraged, 
with the URDP providing part of the investment finance as a grant. Component 1 is 
subdivided into five subcomponents: (i) establishment of multi-stakeholder 
platforms (MSPs) focusing on social mobilization activities; (ii) building of economic 
infrastructure to support the clusters, focusing on civil engineering activities; 
(iii) support to farmer skills training and organization; (iv) support to targeted 
individual investment, focusing on cofinancing activities through CIPs; and 
3 
EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
(v) regional branding and geographical indication, focusing on studies of products 
and quality assessment activities. 
19.  Component 2: Inclusive rural finance. This component promotes financial 
inclusion in targeted areas, thus expanding agricultural and agribusiness 
investment plans and consequently improving livelihoods and increasing 
employment opportunities for rural youth, women, smallholder farmers and the 
target group in general. Its aim is to set up a rural credit guarantee facility 
(subcomponent 2.1) to reduce collateral requirements for new investment loans, 
and a rural finance support facility (subcomponent 2.2) to improve the bankability 
of new investment loan proposals and strengthen the ability of the poorest 
segments to graduate into businesses that can undertake profitable rural 
initiatives. In the longer term, participating financial institutions improve their 
understanding of the rural sector and eventually develop agricultural risk 
assessment tools and mechanisms, thus eliminating the issue of collateral. 
20.  Component  3:  Programme  management.  This  component  covers  all  activities 
related to programme management and implementation. 
D.  Costs, benefits and financing  
Programme costs 
21.  The URDP is financed over an eight-year period at an estimated total cost of 
EUR 98.14 million (originally) and EUR 73.50 million (following the reduction in the 
PBAS). It is being implemented in two phases, over two funding cycles. Each of the 
two phases is expected to run for five years, with an overlap of two years. The 
largest component in terms of cost is component 1 – clustering for resilient rural 
transformation (85.8 per cent of phase two total costs). Programme management 
and coordination represent 11 per cent of phase two total costs.

Financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
22.  The total programme cost of EUR 73.50 million will be financed by an IFAD loan of 
EUR 35.15 million and a second IFAD loan of EUR 19.09 million. An IFAD grant of 
EUR 0.90 million has been allocated mainly for knowledge management and South-
South Cooperation activities. The Government's contribution will be 
EUR 10.41 million over the two phases, and beneficiary contributions are estimated 
at EUR 7.94 million. Government cofinancing is allocated to: (i) seconding 
programme staff to provincial and regional levels; (ii) construction of roads; and 
(iii) all taxes and duties on procured goods and services. Cofinancing from the KGF 
that was expected at the time of design did not materialize because of the current 
limited financial capacity of the cofinancier.  
23. 
Disbursement 
IFAD financing will be disbursed in accordance with the IFAD disbursement 
procedures specified in the programme implementation manual and the letter to 
the borrower/recipient. Two designated accounts have been opened for the 
5 
EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
programme at the Central Bank of Turkey in euro for the IFAD loans and IFAD 
grant separately, with an authorized allocation of approximately six months of 
programme expenditure. Payments in local currency are converted using the 
prevailing exchange rates on the date of payment. Replenishments to the 
designated accounts use the imprest modality. Withdrawal applications will be 
prepared by the central programme management unit (CPMU) every three months 
or when 30 per cent of the advance has been expended, whichever occurs earlier.  
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
24.  Programme benefits are expected to derive from: (i) promoting expansion of 
competitive clusters for a portfolio of products where smallholders may have a 
comparative advantage; (ii) investing in specific crops and livestock that give high 
returns to smallholders and to other actors along the value chains; (iii) providing 
households with business skills; (iv) improving access to market infrastructure; 
and (v) improving access to financial services for both smallholders and small and 
medium-sized enterprises. The main impact will come through a more equitable, 
balanced and inclusive development process that reduces the divide between the 
coastal and plains areas and uplands regions. Consequently, smallholders in upland 
areas will see increased incomes from farming, processing and employment 
opportunities brought about by clustering and financial inclusion (see updated 
summary of the economic and financial analysis in appendix II). 
25.  The overall economic rate of return over 20 years is estimated at 14.7 per cent and 
the net present value, discounted at 10 per cent, is positive (Euro 30.8 million). 
The benefit-cost ratio is 1.85. These indicators establish the economic feasibility of 
the URDP. 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
26.  There are robust built-in sustainability mechanisms. Most importantly, motivated 
by domestic and regional market demand over the long term, the strong focus on 
profitability – for both individual economic agents and groups – will drive 
commercial sustainability and build strong incentives for maintaining the structures 
after programme completion. A supportive infrastructure component is also built 
into the cluster design in critical ways: (i) by application of a demand-driven, cost-
sharing approach; and (ii) by enhancing the target group’s capacity for increasing 
entrepreneurship and the productivity of existing resources, with the goal of more 
efficient and more profitable use of existing natural resources (farmland, pasture 
and water). This, in turn, will enable target groups to increase their resilience to 
commercial and environmental challenges – and will provide them with both a 
financial incentive and the means to finance recurrent costs of investments with 
options for increasing productive investments. Access to financial services is a key 
sustainable exit strategy of the URDP. By addressing the single most important 
access constraint, that of insufficient collateral, and deploying financing products 
suitable for smallholders through the KGF credit guarantee facility, the URDP will 
increase the penetration and depth of financial services in rural areas and catalyse 
smallholders’ integration into commercial clusters that provide a credible pathway 
out of poverty. Evidence of a functioning EDC model will inform policy engagement 
with local and national government authorities to encourage expansion of the 
model’s use by other development initiatives supported by the Government and 
other development actors. 
III.  Risk management 
A.  Risks and mitigation measures 
27.  At the macro level, governance and political commitment risks are deemed 
moderate to low, as the country has seen robust continuity for more than three 
decades. The component-specific risks are also within acceptable levels.  
28.  The risk associated with disbursement and limited capacity for fiduciary aspects is 
moderate to low. A fiduciary team was set up, a memorandum of understanding 
6 
EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
was signed with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to provide 
technical assistance in procurement and financial management, and continuous 
capacity-building is planned to strengthen skills and promote best practices in 
fiduciary management. 
29.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a substantial risk, as its socio-economic 
impact is likely to continue. The IFAD Country Office has therefore scaled up its 
partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and 
UNDP to carry out, under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 
an impact assessment in support of a coordinated sector response. The study 
looked into the food security and livelihoods of vulnerable households, and 
proposed policy recommendations as well as the use of digital solutions to enhance 
producers’ access to market, in a context of social distancing rules. In addition, a 
COVID-19 contingency plan will be included in the annual workplan and budget 
(AWP/B) to ensure continuation of service delivery to the end beneficiaries.  
B.  Environment and social category 
30.  Programme interventions and investments will be directed towards improving 
agricultural practices and pasture management as well as organic agriculture in 
fragile upland ecosystems. The interventions will improve natural resources 
management practices and capacity of all beneficiaries, including government 
officials. Use of the Results and Impact Management System, with input from the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s monitoring system, will ensure early 
identification of any potentially adverse impact of activities where remedial action 
is needed by the Ministry. An additional assessment was carried out under the 
Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures of IFAD (SECAP) in July 
2020 but no justification was found for changing the environmental and social 
category for the programme, which remains a category B operation. 
C.  Climate risk classification  
31.  The initial SECAP mission during project identification and detailed design in 2017 
confirmed that the proposed target area was not identified in current predictions 
and databases as a high climate risk area. Rough topography brings intrinsic 
threats of landslides and floods. Nonetheless, the initial analysis of the past 34 
years’ climatic trends confirms an increase of temperature in each target district. 
At the provincial level, there is no evident change in the trends of the normalized 
difference vegetation index. The proposed climate risk category remains moderate. 
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Compliance with IFAD policies 
32.  The URDP is fully aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025 for 
enabling inclusive and sustainable rural transformation. Indeed, it aims to 
transform Turkey’s upland smallholders towards commercial competitiveness and 
greater climatic resilience. The programme is also in compliance with IFAD’s 
private sector strategy and policies on rural enterprise, women's empowerment 
and gender equality, and targeting. 
B.  Organizational framework 
Management and coordination 
33.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is the lead implementing agency. Overall 
URDP management is carried out by the Ministry’s General Directorate of 
Agricultural Reform, which is responsible for providing overall policy guidance and 
oversight. Day-to-day management and implementation is tasked to the existing 
CPMU. Its principal functions are to carry out the overall programming and 
budgeting of activities – in cooperation with the two regional programme 
management units (RPMUs) and implementing partners – and to monitor and 
document progress.

EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
Financial management, procurement and governance  
34.  Governance and financial management risks. The inherent country risk is 
rated substantial. The 2014 Governance Diagnostic Assessment for Turkey 
confirmed the findings of the World Bank’s 2009 Public Financial Management 
Performance Benchmarking Study, showing major transformation of public sector 
management as a result of the reform initiatives. Implementation challenges 
remain, and there are still areas where improvement is required. 
35.  Financial management. In previous projects, financial management and 
procurement have been outsourced to UNDP and were rated satisfactory. UNDP will 
gradually transfer this responsibility to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to 
increase the Ministry’s ownership and capacity to manage donor-funded projects. 
Overall, financial management risk is rated as moderate, improving to low after the 
conditions for disbursement and proposed mitigation measures have been met. The 
main mitigation measures include: (i) recruitment of professional financial 
management staff; (ii) installation of an accounting software system; (iii) drafting 
of a programme implementation manual acceptable to IFAD; (iv) a memorandum 
of understanding between the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and KGF; and 
(v) internal and external audits. 
36.  Accounting and financial reporting arrangements. The programme has 
adopted accounting procedures and policies consistent with acceptable 
international accounting standards and government requirements. Accounts and 
financial reporting are managed at the CPMU, which is also responsible for ensuring 
that funds have been used for the purposes intended. The programme uses the 
government public expenditures system developed by the Ministry of Treasury and 
Finance to process all payments from the government counterpart contribution. 
The Survey and Project Department (SPD) is working on acquiring and installing an 
accounting software that is capable of producing all required reports in line with 
IFAD's requirements. 
37.  Internal and external audit arrangements. The Internal Audit Department 
(IAD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry audits the Ministry’s work in 
general. SPD is negotiating and coordinating with IAD to include IFAD projects in 
the workplan, including the use of IFAD funds by the intended end beneficiaries. 
IAD will be reviewing the effectiveness of the internal control systems. For external 
audit, annual programme financial statements are audited by the treasury 
controller, which currently performs the external audits for all World Bank and IFAD 
projects, in accordance with International Standards on Auditing under terms of 
reference approved by IFAD each year. The credit guarantee facility will be audited 
as part of the annual audit by the external auditor. 
38.  Governance. In accordance with IFAD guidelines, bidding documents and 
contracts for the procurement of goods, works and services financed from 
resources funded or administered by IFAD must include a provision requiring 
suppliers, contractors and consultants to: (i) ensure compliance with IFAD’s 
anticorruption policy; and (ii) allow IFAD to inspect their accounts, records and 
other documents relating to bid submission and contract performance, and have 
them audited if deemed necessary. Stakeholder engagement will be enhanced by 
setting up a complaint and grievance mechanism by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Forestry, and a periodic third-party evaluation to collect feedback from 
stakeholders. 
39.  Procurement. The existing legal framework for public procurement in Turkey is 
assessed as broadly in compliance with international standards. 
C.  Monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge management 
and strategic communication 
40.  The main planning tool is the AWP/B, which is prepared using a participatory 
bottom-up approach within the economic clusters and in line with the logical 
8 
EB 2020/LOT/P.11 
framework. Once priorities have been set at the cluster level and activities defined, 
an AWP/B is compiled by the RPMUs for each province, consolidated for their 
respective regions and then submitted to the CPMU for consolidation and 
transmission to SPD for inclusion in the budget. The draft AWP/B is sent to IFAD for 
review and no objection, guides the implementation of cluster activities and 
provides benchmarks against which implementation progress is measured each 
year. 
41.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The M&E system takes a results-based 
approach – accounting for progress against AWP/B targets and periodically 
assessing progress towards achievement of impact. While the two RPMU M&E 
assistants have primary responsibility for the system, all other implementation 
agencies at provincial, district and cluster levels play important roles in collecting 
and analysing data to assess the outcomes and impact of programme activities. 
The CPMU M&E specialist has overall coordination responsibility. The programme 
uses the georeferencing methodology to support implementation and M&E 
processes. 
42.  Knowledge management. Both IFAD and the Government perceive the URDP as 
a considerable investment in learning about how to counter increasing isolation, 
depopulation and inequality between rural and urban areas. Knowledge generation 
aimed at influencing policy and replication of the EDC approach by the Government 
and MSP actors will be the main scaling up pathway, and the programme will 
enable the Government to generate knowledge on the impact of CIPs and 
investments and inform successive government programme pipeline development 
and best use of investments to benefit rural upland farmers. Additionally, grant 
funding is included in the programme for knowledge-sharing of the economic 
cluster approach for poverty reduction in mountainous ecosystems in similar 
countries through South-South Cooperation. 
D.  Proposed amendments to the financing agreement 
43.  Subject to approval of the additional financing by the Executive Board, the URDP 
financing agreement will be amended to revise the allocation of IFAD financing to 
include the additional resources. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
44.  A financing agreement between the Republic of Turkey and IFAD will constitute the 
legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/recipient. 
The signed financing agreement will be amended following approval of the 
additional financing. 
45.  The Republic of Turkey is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 
IFAD. 
46. 
I am satisfied that the proposed additional financing will comply with the 
Agreement Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
VI.  Recommendation 
47. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the additional financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the 
Republic of Turkey in an amount of nineteen million ninety-four thousand 
euros (EUR 19,094,000) and upon such terms and conditions as shall be 
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.
