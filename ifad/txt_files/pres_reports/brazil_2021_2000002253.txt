Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in  
paragraph 60. 
I.  Context  
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
1.  National context. The North-east Brazil (NEB) region, spanning nine states and 
over 1.5 million km², has a population of 56.5 million. Over half of Brazilians living 
in extreme poverty (59.1 per cent) dwell in the region, whose semi-arid areas are 
home to about 21.3 million people.  
2. 
3. 
4. 
Poverty Context. A number of social problems plague the region, especially its 
semi-arid lands where around 50 per cent of people live in poverty. Extreme 
poverty rates reach some 40 per cent in some states. Rural infant mortality in the 
region is almost double the national average, while the illiteracy rate is three to 
four times as high. The region’s nine states figure among the least developed of 
Brazil’s 26 states (plus one federal district), as measured by the Human 
Development Index.  
Rural development context. Family farms account for over 90 per cent of all 
farms in NEB semi-arid areas. Farmers are particularly vulnerable because of 
limited access to water: the NEB region is subject to periodic droughts and chronic 
water scarcity. Moreover, a strong imbalance in land ownership (including scarce 
access to land by women) contributes to the vulnerability of small-scale farmers.  
Climate change context. Family farmers are among those most affected by 
climate change. The average crop area lost because of droughts in the 1990–2016 
period was 222,000 hectares per year. Given characteristically low productivity in 
the semi-arid lands, such losses pose a direct threat to local food security. A severe 
drought in 2011–2017 further indebted farmers and intensified migration, disease 
and malnutrition. 
5. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD’s corporate mainstreaming priorities  
In line with the mainstreaming commitments of the Eleventh Replenishment of 
IFAD’s Resources (IFAD11), the project has been validated as: 
☒ Including climate finance;  
☒ Gender transformational;  
☒ Nutrition-sensitive;  
☒ Youth-sensitive.  
6. 
7. 
Climate change. The direct correlation between increasing temperatures and 
higher variability in rainfall leads to prolonged droughts and frequent periods of 
water scarcity. While these climate trends affect the entire NEB economy, some 
factors make smallholders particularly susceptible. They include: (i) the high 
incidence of poverty; (ii) scarce ability to cope with prolonged droughts and 
harvest losses; (iii) water shortages and poor water quality; (iv) inadequate 
productive practices that further degrade the soil and its water retention capacity; 
and (v) deforestation of NEB’s highly biodiverse Caatinga ecoregion, depleting vital 
ecosystem services there.  
Rural youth. NEB youth migration to urban areas increases the ageing of rural 
populations. Two in three Brazilian teenagers living in poverty live in NEB’s semi-
arid areas. NEB provides little attractive employment as local jobs offer a 
combination of low incomes and harsh working conditions, together with poor basic 
services.  
1 
EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
8.  Gender. Gender inequality is deeply pervasive in rural NEB. Women and men have 
different roles in their households and communities, with women having little say 
in domestic or public affairs. They work in the home and in subsistence crop 
production, assuming a disproportionate share of the workload. Most farms below 
5 hectares are managed by women, and 87.3 per cent of women farmers in Brazil 
receive no technical assistance (TA). Finally, the incidence of gender-based 
violence is alarming.  
9.  Nutrition. In recent decades, economic and social advances have generally 
improved public health and food consumption. Between 1996 and 2007, child 
stunting in NEB dropped from 22.2 per cent to 5.9 per cent. But despite marked 
reductions in chronic malnutrition, improvements have not been homogeneous. For 
example, traditional and indigenous peoples, who have the highest poverty rates, 
are more exposed to nutritional vulnerability.  
10.  Indigenous and traditional peoples. Indigenous and traditional communities, 
who depend on natural resources and ecosystem services, are particularly affected 
by climate change, marginalization and lack of services. Extreme poverty affects 
indigenous people six times as much as other Brazilians. Infant mortality rates 
among indigenous children are significantly higher than the national average. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
11.  The Planting Climate Resilience in Rural Communities of the North-east Project 
(PCRP) will support smallholders in adopting agricultural climate-resilient 
productive systems (CRPS), which are designed to increase the availability, flow 
and soil retention of water. This requires introducing behavioural changes, 
fostering rural organizations and making productive investments – all areas in 
which IFAD has a comparative advantage and which build on IFAD’s existing 
investment portfolio in NEB. 
12.  The project confirms IFAD’s strategic commitment to rural transformation in NEB. 
It will focus on empowering the most disadvantaged groups, including women and 
youth, and indigenous and traditional peoples. Its financing structure leverages 
IFAD’s 2016 accreditation with the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which gave IFAD 
access to GCF climate financing. IFAD is able to channel these resources, in the 
form of concessional loans and grants, to the world’s most vulnerable populations. 
The project also builds on IFAD’s experience with NEB states and local 
stakeholders.  
B.  Lessons learned 
13.  Project design benefits from lessons learned during previous IFAD interventions 
and draws on the findings of country programme evaluations, project performance 
assessments, impact assessments and results surveys. Experience in small-scale 
water infrastructure for agroforestry has proved particularly valuable. As regards 
project financing, one recurring problem in the past was that the Federal 
Government would often fail to approve a project because of the recipient state’s 
deteriorated finances. In order to guard against this eventuality, the PCRP uses an 
innovative multi-state approach. It was also found that climate resilience 
interventions, such as water harvesting and storage units, were often introduced 
during project implementation rather than at design. IFAD also concluded that the 
design of its previous projects in Brazil could be improved to further enhance the 
participation of women, youth and traditional communities.

EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
II.  Project description 
A.  Objectives, geographical area of intervention and target 
groups  
14.  The project objective is to reduce the impact of climate change and increase the 
resilience of affected population in the largely semi-arid NEB region. The project 
will support family farmers and their communities in reversing the decline in 
productivity caused by the degradation of agroecosystems. It will introduce 
technologies for water harvesting, storage and recycling, and diversification 
strategies to strengthen rural populations’ resilience.  
15.  Expected outcomes: (i) increased resilience and enhanced livelihoods for the 
most vulnerable people, communities and areas; and (ii) improved diets, nutrition 
and food security in households. 
16.  The project will directly reach 250,000 smallholder families, or about one million 
people. The main selection criterion for accessing project services will be poverty. 
In addition, women and youth will be specifically targeted and traditional and 
indigenous communities will be included as beneficiaries wherever possible.  
17.  The project targeting strategy includes: 
(i)  Geographical area. Some three states will be selected for early 
implementation, based on their borrowing ability from the Brazilian 
Development Bank (BNDES) and their counterpart financing capacity. Other 
criteria include poverty, climate vulnerability, food and nutrition security, 
water availability, implementation capacity and commitment to the project. 
Subprojects will require a statement of no objection from IFAD. 
(ii)  As an eligibility criterion for poverty targeting, at least 70 per cent of the 
families of each participating community need to be registered in the Unified 
Registry of families, for which family members’ individual incomes may not 
exceed 50 per cent of the minimum wage. At least 40 per cent of 
beneficiaries must be women and 50 per cent young people aged below 29. 
(iii)  Participating municipalities will be selected according to criteria that include 
environmental precariousness (signs of deforestation, erosion and soil 
degradation), food and nutritional insecurity, drought damage and access to 
quality water.  
(iv)  Within the participating municipalities, state-level implementing units (SIUs) 
will select the communities and other groups of farming families to implement 
project activities, including local traditional and indigenous groupings where 
present. 
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
18.  The project will have three mutually supportive components. 
19.  Component 1. Climate-resilient productive systems.  
 
 
Subcomponent 1.1. Selection of project areas and development of 
territorial resilience investment plans (TRIPs) will be carried out for the 
participating communities to guide the project’s collective and individual 
investments in CRPS as well as water harvesting and storage infrastructure. 
Subcomponent 1.2. Implement CRPS in family farms and backyard 
gardens. This will support groups with household-based productive 
investments that increase resilience to climate change. The group-based 
approach will facilitate joint learning and the adoption of technologies and 
practices to implement CRPS, with TA for capacity-building and initial 
monitoring. The activity includes productive farming and backyard gardens. 
3 
EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
 
 
Subcomponent 1.3. Implement collective resilient investments. With 
population and land use increasing in NEB, its Caatinga ecoregion – one of 
the world’s richest in biodiversity – is under threat of gradual depletion, 
mainly due to timber extraction for firewood and to overgrazing. The 
activities will improve ecosystem services in common areas, educate students 
on how to implement CRPS and pilot productive activities using effluent from 
desalination plants. 
Subcomponent 1.4. Build a farmers’ network and promote local 
entrepreneurship for products and services that support family 
farming. This will facilitate the replication of CRPS through: (i) TA teams 
adopting a territory-based intervention strategy; and (ii) small grants and 
business management support to microenterprises that innovate and produce 
specific tools and equipment to facilitate CRPS implementation.  
20.  Component 2. Water access for production. 
 
 
 
Subcomponent 2.1. Build boardwalk cisterns for backyard gardens, 
small farm ponds and groundwater storage basins. 
Subcomponent 2.2. Implement social technologies to increase water 
in the fields, such as building small farm ponds and groundwater storage 
basins. 
Subcomponent 2.3. Implement treatment and reuse systems for 
household wastewater to allow smallholder households to treat and reuse 
their wastewater. 
21.  Component 3. Knowledge management (KM) and scaling up. 
 
 
 
Subcomponent 3.1. Raise awareness and build the capacities of 
women, youth and traditional communities. This activity will: 
(i) highlight the role of youth and women as knowledge managers and 
generators; (ii) consolidate learning, exchange and replication of sustainable 
practices in communities; and (iii) facilitate dynamic monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) of socio-environmental impacts to inform public 
policymaking. 
Subcomponent 3.2. Drive scaling up, unlock policy barriers and 
experiment with CRPS and resilience participatory monitoring model. 
This will promote South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC); facilitate 
discussions to unlock policy barriers; and experiment with CRPS and the 
participatory monitoring of resilience.  
Subcomponent 3.3. Plan, monitor, evaluate and learn. The project will 
customize the M&E system currently used by all IFAD-supported projects in 
Brazil. Independent surveys for baseline, midterm review and closing 
evaluation will be carried out at state level. 
C.  Theory of change  
22.  Family farmers in semi-arid lands rely on agriculture for their livelihoods but are 
threatened by the pressure on the land and climate change. Faced with reduced 
productivity, farmers turn to practices that accelerate soil degradation and the loss 
of biodiversity, thus further reducing yields.  
23.  To counter this trend, the project will promote CRPS and on-farm water 
management such as rainwater harvesting and storage, supported by investments 
and TA. These practices will improve vegetation cover, plant diversity, soil biomass 
and fertility and the availability of water in the system. To ensure the changes are 
transformative and sustainable, TA will also train women and youth to foster 
leadership, reorganize social roles, strengthen farmers’ organizations and 
networks, help access markets, and stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation. 
4 
EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
These efforts will lead to sustainable transformation that is well understood and 
owned by participating households. 
24.  Through these practices, the project will result in resilient and productive farming 
systems performing restored ecosystem services, which, in turn, both increase and 
stabilize family incomes, empower women and youth, and improve food and 
nutrition security. 
25.  The project’s KM efforts, including SSTC and M&E, will allow the investments to be 
sustained and scaled up to other states in the region. They will also serve as the 
basis for sharing field experiences with the forum of state secretaries for family 
farming of the north-east and the consortium of the north-east governors, which 
play major roles in policy dialogue for family farming in NEB. 
D.  Alignment, ownership and partnerships 
26.  The project is included in the Brazilian national strategy for the GCF and is aligned 
with the Brazilian National Policy on Climate Change, nationally determined 
contribution, national programmes to strengthen family agriculture (such as the 
Brazilian National Programme to Strengthen Family Farming), the National Plan for 
Food and Nutrition Security, the National Policy for the Sustainable Development of 
Traditional Peoples and Communities, and the Food Purchase Programme. 
27. 
It is also aligned with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, with all four 
elements of the IFAD11 mainstreaming agenda and with the results-based country 
strategic opportunities programme (2016-2021) for Brazil, including its strategy of 
building partnerships to join experiences, knowledge, intervention capacity and 
resources.  
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
28.  All project components contribute partially towards climate finance. In line with the 
multilateral development banks’ methodologies for tracking climate change 
adaptation and mitigation finance, the total amount of climate finance for this 
project is estimated at US$28,309,000 or 94.4 per cent of the IFAD investment; of 
which US$13,236,000 supports adaptation activities and US$15,073,000 mitigation 
activities.  
Project management 
29.  Although not a separate component, according to GCF guidelines, management 
activities are grouped under a separate heading, including the establishment and 
operation of the SIUs at state level. BNDES will have the role of central project 
management unit (CPMU). 
Project costs 
30.  The total project costs over the eight-year period are estimated at 
US$217.8 million, including contingencies and taxes. Base costs are estimated at 
US$212.3 million and both physical and price contingencies represent 
US$5.5 million (2.5 per cent of total costs). Investment costs are estimated at 
US$204.1 million and recurrent costs US$13.7 million. Additional costs associated 
with the CPMU operating costs financed by BNDES are not included in the project 
costs.

Financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
31.  The project will be financed with: (i) a US$30 million loan from IFAD; 
US$99.5 million from GCF (US$65.0 million as a loan and US$34.5 million a grant); 
US$73.0 million in national counterpart funds in the form of loans by BNDES to the 
participating states and from states’ own resources; and US$15.3 million in-kind 
from the beneficiaries. The project is due to be presented to the twenty-seventh 
GCF Board in November 2020 for approval.  
Disbursement 
32.  GCF and IFAD funds will be deposited in separate designated accounts for each 
financing in United States dollars, opened and maintained by BNDES, exclusively 
for PCRP financing. BNDES will open and maintain an operational account for 
transfers to the states’ operational accounts. BNDES’s resources will be deposited 
in the states’ operational accounts. The financing will be used exclusively to fund 
eligible expenditures in line with the approved annual workplan and budget 
(AWPB). Disbursement procedures will be included in the letter to the 
borrower/recipient to be sent by IFAD upon signature of the financing agreement. 
BNDES will use the IFAD Client Portal to submit withdrawal applications and access 
financial information.  
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
33.  The financial analysis shows that all production models are profitable, with financial 
internal rates of return ranging from 10 per cent to 39 per cent. The economic 
6 
EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
analysis demonstrates the project’s profitability, with an economic rate of return of 
19.8 per cent and net present value of US$152 million. The benefit-cost ratio is 
3.18. 
34.  The project would not be profitable in case of substantial cost increases and benefit 
reductions. Project benefits are diversified and thus not highly exposed to price or 
sectoral risks. 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
35.  The project interventions have potential to be scaled up by BNDES, federal 
ministries, states and other actors. Farmers’ organizations and civil society will be 
important partners, ensuring that capacity-building is consolidated and 
disseminated as part of the project’s approach. The exit strategy relies on the 
project’s improvement of beneficiaries’ livelihoods and the creation of an enabling 
environment for climate-resilient agriculture. Local implementation, handover of 
completed activities to communities, KM and partnerships will sustain the 
interventions and pathways for scaling up the project after completion. By the end 
of the project, it is expected that family farmers and communities will be capable of 
using and further developing CRPS practices, including the maintenance of water 
harvesting, storage and recycling structures. In addition, extension service 
providers will have specialized skills to continue supporting farmers, and KM 
systems will be maintained and used to inform policies. 
III.  Risks 
Risks and mitigation measures  
36.  The project overall risk is classified as moderate and is detailed in the integrated 
project risk matrix. The main risks concern policies and governance, sector 
strategies, and macroeconomic and financial management (FM). Main risks arise 
from possible misalignments between strategies, especially on climate change, 
between policies, especially of states and the Federal Government; and between 
macroeconomic requirements, such as states’ compliance with domestic borrowing 
capacity. In addition, FM risks stem from complex financial arrangements. 
Mitigation measures include design consultations and stakeholder dialogue during 
implementation. The partnership with BNDES is a key mitigation factor as it 
assures dialogue between federal and state levels. The project’s advisory 
committee will promote alignment with other government programmes and 
policies. The complexity of the project’s financial arrangement will be mitigated by 
a single expenditure category and efforts to support the timely preparation, 
negotiation and signature of legal agreements. The project’s supervision 
arrangements will be facilitated by IFAD’s country presence and experience in NEB.  
37.  As the PCRP will be implemented in poor, remote rural areas, it is probable that 
COVID-19 will continue to be a risk. This will be mitigated by strict behavioural 
protocols, the use of virtual tools to train TA providers and liaison with state health 
departments.

Environment and social category  
38.  The project is classified as category B. Anticipated environmental and social 
impacts that may arise from project implementation are minimal and related to 
CRPS. The project’s gender-transformative strategy would increase gender equality 
and empowerment. The project’s environmental and social management plan will 
ensure that water-related activities respect natural flows and comply with health 
and environmental standards. In addition, a participatory indigenous people’s plan 
will apply the free prior and informed consent principles. Adequate monitoring and 
verification of safeguard compliance is considered throughout project life. 
Climate risk classification 
39.  The project is classified as high climate risk. An analysis of drought events 
between 1981 and 2016 shows that drought intensity for the last 36 years has 
been increasing in NEB. 
Debt sustainability  
40.  An International Monetary Fund debt sustainability analysis dated July 2019 
indicated that debt sustainability risks remain high. In another year of 
disappointing growth, Brazil’s gross debt increased by 3.8 percentage points in 
2018, reaching 87.9 per cent of GDP. Public debt is projected to peak at 96 per 
cent of GDP in 2024.  
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Project management and coordination 
IFAD will be responsible for project supervision and for reporting to GCF. 
41. 
42.  BNDES, a public development bank wholly owned by the Federal Government with 
legal personality incorporated under Brazilian corporate law, will be the project’s 
executing entity and the borrower/recipient of the IFAD and GCF funds. It will 
operate the domestic sublending to the participating states. 
43.  The CPMU within BNDES will coordinate and monitor implementation, compile 
physical and financial information, report to IFAD and be generally accountable for 
the implementation of the project. 
44.  SIUs will be responsible for coordination, procurement, FM and M&E of the  
state-level subprojects, in line with the subsidiary agreements between the states 
and BNDES.  
45.  An advisory committee will advise the CPMU on the general direction of project 
execution and promote coordination with other government projects, programmes 
and policies. It shall be composed of representatives from several agencies of the 
Federal Government, civil society, state-level subprojects, BNDES and the Ministry 
of the Economy. 
46.  At the state level, consultative councils with the participation of beneficiaries and 
representatives from civil society and state secretariats will review the AWPB and 
advise on TRIPs prior to their submission for approval to the CPMU. 
Financial management, procurement and governance  
47.  Financial management. The CPMU will have overall responsibility for FM and will 
be appropriately staffed to exercise it. The main FM functions will be: 
(i) consolidate the AWPB; (ii) financial reporting; (iii) monitor liquidity 
requirements and prepare withdrawal applications; (iv) implement and maintain at 
central and state level an integrated FM system or an alternative arrangement 
acceptable to IFAD; (v) ensure independent annual audits are carried out in time; 
and (vi) ensure that overall internal controls are effective and that participating 
states comply with subsidiary agreements, the project implementation manual, and 
IFAD procurement and FM procedures and requirements. The SIUs’ responsibilities 
8 
EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
will include: (i) preparing the AWPB; (ii) FM and reporting; (iii) collaborating with 
the auditors; and (iv) ensuring that the internal controls are sound and project 
activities are compliant with the subsidiary agreements, the project implementation 
manual, and IFAD procurement and FM procedures and requirements. 
48.  External audit. The project will be audited annually by the supreme audit 
institution, or a private auditing firm hired for this purpose, in accordance with 
international auditing standards. The consolidated annual audit report, including all 
sources of funding and participating states, will be submitted to IFAD within six 
months of the end of the fiscal year.  
49.  Procurement. Project procurement will be carried out in accordance with Brazilian 
legislation and use national and state-level procurement systems, applying current 
rules and procedures. According to a World Bank assessment of the national 
procurement methods in 2010, Brazil complies with international standards in 
terms of: (i) legislative and regulatory framework; (ii) institutional framework and 
management capacity; (iii) procurement operations and market practices; and 
(iv) integrity and transparency of public systems. Additionally, all project bidding 
processes and contracts will contain IFAD anti-fraud and corruption provisions, as 
well as safeguards on sexual harassment, exploitation and abuse. The prior review 
arrangements to be detailed in the letter to the borrower/recipient will include the 
AWPB and the procurement plan. 
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communication 
50.  A planning, monitoring, evaluation and learning system will be developed for 
results-based project management. The data and information collected on CRPS 
will contribute to learning, feedback and improvement of project interventions, and 
will build the basis for KM. In addition, the documentation and dissemination of 
good practices and successful experiences will support SSTC schemes, and links to 
KM grant activities will be established. A resilience scorecard and index will be used 
to monitor changes in the resilience capacity of families. 
51.  Innovation. This is the first IFAD-supported project in Brazil focusing on climate 
adaptation issues by linking sustainable production systems with water 
management approaches. Another innovative feature of the project is its 
governance architecture. Channelling resources through BNDES to the participating 
states will allow high implementation efficiency and effectiveness compared to 
lending directly to the states. Moreover, the involvement of BNDES as a strategic 
partner brings with it experience with CRPS investments, resource mobilization 
capacity and scope to apply lessons learned from the project to BNDES’s 
agricultural credit lines, enabling replication at the national scale. 
52.  Scaling up. The project will promote knowledge exchanges and young 
communicator networks inspired by popular education. A database, a web portal 
and KM materials will provide information on fostering climate resilience 
throughout the NEB region and to other drylands in Latin America and Africa. In 
addition, the project will foster policy dialogue within the states. 
C.  Implementation plans 
53.  The project will capitalize on the experience of the ongoing IFAD portfolio at state 
level. In addition, the IFAD-grant-supported Dryland Adaptation Knowledge 
Initiative will build implementation capacity, and other regional grants will support 
management and technical aspects. This will ensure strong implementation 
readiness, to be supported by start-up activities led by IFAD and BNDES. The focus 
will be on rapidly selecting the participating states, finalizing the subsidiary 
agreements with the states and building up the SIU teams. A start-up workshop 
will be held in each participating state. 
9 
EB 2020/131/R.6/Rev.1  
54.  The PCRP will be under the direct supervision of IFAD. In order to facilitate project 
implementation in a multi-state environment, IFAD will conduct state-based and 
project-wide supervision missions. A midterm review will be carried out in the fifth 
year of the project, and a joint completion review will be undertaken by IFAD and 
BNDES before completion.  
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
55.  A financing agreement between BNDES and IFAD, and a separate guarantee 
agreement between the Federative Republic of Brazil and IFAD will constitute the legal 
instruments for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/recipient. A copy of 
the negotiated financing agreement and of the guarantee agreement will be made 
available subsequently. 
56.  The financing agreement and guarantee agreement with the borrower and 
guarantor, respectively, shall reflect the relevant financial and technical conditions 
to be agreed between the GCF and IFAD in the Funded Activity Agreement (FAA). 
In line with the GCF Accreditation Master Agreement, the Executive Board’s 
approval of the project is a precondition for the signature of the FAA, and in 
accordance with GCF’s practice of prioritizing projects that have obtained the 
accredited entities’ approval, the FAA negotiations can be concluded only after the 
approval of the Executive Board. Accordingly, the negotiations of the financing 
agreement and guarantee agreement with the borrower and the guarantor will 
commence immediately after the FAA has been negotiated, with the objective of 
being concluded as early as possible within the first quarter of 2021. 
57. 
In accordance with the above sequencing, the negotiated texts of the financing 
agreement and guarantee agreement will be submitted at a subsequent Executive 
Board session, together with any substantive change to the key terms of IFAD 
financing, which are presented in appendix IV. 
58.  BNDES is empowered under its corporate laws and under Brazilian legislation to 
receive financing from IFAD and the Federative Republic of Brazil is empowered under 
Brazilian law to guarantee the financing. 
59. 
IFAD financing to BNDES represents funding to a national development bank, 
based on a due diligence of the creditworthiness and implementation capabilities of 
BNDES. 
VI.  Recommendation 
60. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the 
Brazilian Development Bank in an amount of thirty million United States 
dollars (US$30 million) and upon such terms and conditions as shall be 
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.

Integrated project risk matrix 
Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Country Context 
Political Commitment 
Risk(s): Misalignments between state governments and the 
Federal Government could lead to implementation 
problems. 
Mitigations: This will be mitigated by having the design 
documentation thoroughly discussed at both state and 
federal levels through consultations and dialogue by IFAD 
Hub in Brasilia mainly with federal partners, and IFAD 
Satellite Office in Salvador, mainly with subnational entities 
(states), as well as various partners and stakeholders such 
as civil society, farmers’ organizations, research 
organizations, among others. Stakeholder consultations will 
be carried out and constant dialogue with states ensured by 
collaboration with the Forum of State Secretaries and 
Northeast Consortium of Governors.  
The partnership with BNDES, a national government body 
directly tied to the Ministry of Economy, mitigates this risk, 
assuring dialogue between federal and state levels. IFAD 
Salvador office will continue its strong dialogue with 
BNDES. In addition, collaboration and dialogue will continue 
with other federal partners mainly Ministry of Agriculture 
(MAPA), Ministry of Citizenship and Ministry of Environment 
(MMA) as well as other federal agencies such as CODEVASF 
and EMBRAPA. Mitigation will also ensure cooperation with 
federal universities and think-tanks such as UNB and UFV. 
Governance 
Moderate 
Moderate 
Risk(s): The risk that the country exhibits governance 
failures that may undermine project implementation and 
achievement of project development objectives. This 
includes lack of or weak: political checks and balances; 
public auditing systems; transparent information on 
government rules, regulations, and decisions; standards to 
prevent fraud and corruption; quality and transparency of 
allocation of resources for rural development. 
Mitigations: This risk will be mitigated by strong 
implementation support and supervision missions by IFAD 
as well as acquired capacities from previous IFAD projects 
in the country. IFAD capacity building and training on 
fiduciary aspects will also be critical. IFAD missions will 
ensure to include fiduciary experts in the area of financial 
management and procurement. 
Moderate 
Moderate 
Macroeconomic 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s): The risk that macroeconomic policies, such as 
monetary, fiscal, debt management/sustainability, and 
trade policies are not robust, are unsustainable, and/or are 
vulnerable to domestic or external shocks (e.g. resulting in 
high inflation, low foreign exchange reserves, large fiscal 
deficits, debt distress), undermining government capacity 
to mobilize counterpart funding, and significantly impacting

Residual 
market dynamics of value chains, including market prices 
and profit margins for project target groups.  
Mitigations: Borrowing ability: Northeast states would need 
to have a qualified domestic debt rating to have a loan 
agreement with BNDES. Ratings are provided by BNDES. 
Only states with credit ratings will qualify. The flexible 
approach adopted by the project of selecting states at the 
time of project implementation reduces significantly the risk 
of not having enough states that qualify among the nine 
northeastern states. On the other hand, fiscal strain on 
states due to factors such as COVID can lead to a reduced 
number of states which will qualify and this needs to be 
monitored constantly. In addition, states need to continue 
to demonstrate appetite and commitment for the project. 
IFAD constant dialogue with BNDES as well as with states 
will be essential especially during the phase of state 
selection. 
Fragility and security 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial   Moderate 
Risk(s): The risk that the country is vulnerable to natural 
and man-made shocks including civil unrest, conflict, 
and/or weak governance structures and institutions 
Mitigations: The main risks of this nature are related to 
climatic shocks such as severe droughts and the nature of 
the project is exactly to build resilience and better 
conditions to face climatic shocks.  
Another risk pertains to criminality or drug trafficking in the 
project area which may impair implementation. This will be 
mitigated by technical assistance (TA) teams and 
continuing monitoring of the situation with the support 
partners, states and UNDSS. 
Sector Strategies and Policies 
Policy alignment 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s): There is a risk that the national government 
changes its policies (especially towards climate change) 
which would result in a misalignment with the project’s 
strategies and objectives. At state level, where the project 
will be implemented, this risk is much lower.  
Mitigations: The partnership with BNDES, a national 
government body directly tied to the Ministry of Economy, 
mitigates this risk, assuring dialogue between federal and 
state levels.  
In addition, PCRP will institute an Advisory Committee in 
the governance to promote the integration and alignment 
with other government projects, programs and policies. It 
shall be composed of representatives from the federal 
government, civil society, states, BNDES, and NDA. 
Policy development & implementation 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s): The risk that the country’s strategies and policies 
governing the rural and agricultural sector lack a sound 
evidence base, are not representative of rural peoples’ 
organizations views, are not adequately resourced or 
supported by legal/regulatory frameworks, and/or are

unsustainable, undermining project implementation and the 
achievement of project development objectives 
Mitigations: The project will build collaboration with 
research organizations as well as with think tanks so as to 
have appropriate views on data and information and in 
order to guide the project implementation. In addition, the 
DAKI grant which will pave the way for the PCRP 
implementation will also ensure to have check and balances 
on the country´s and state´s policies and strategies for 
rural development and climate. The project will also 
establish an Advisory Committee in its governance 
structure to promote the integration and alignment with 
other government projects, programs and policies. It shall 
be composed of representatives from the federal 
government, civil society, states, BNDES, and NDA. The 
Advisory Committee will also serve as a platform for the 
discussion of policies and strategies. In addition, IFAD will 
continue its strong engagement during project 
implementation with key stakeholders such as farmers´ 
organizations and civil society.

Project vulnerability to environmental conditions 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial   Moderate 
Risk(s): Inherent environmental risks for agriculture in NE 
Brazil are drought, increased water salinity, erosion, and 
land degradation 
Mitigations: Extreme environment conditions pose a real 
risk but the PCRP is designed to build resilience of 
communities and improve their agricultural practices to 
better face such conditions. The main risk pertains to 
prolonged drought, which would be critical especially in the 
first years when the CRPS are more vulnerable. To mitigate 
this risk, water harvesting and storage systems will be 
implemented simultaneously in conjunction with some 
CRPS. In addition, it would be possible to accelerate the 
implementation of practices based on the management of 
herds in an emergency and with the use of local natural 
resources. To address the issues of land degradation, 
erosion, and salinity, the project will implement agricultural 
best practices that result in enhanced water management 
and water retention in soils, as well as agroforestry 
practices that increase the quality of soils. 
Project vulnerability to climate change impacts 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s): In the Brazilian semi arid, temperature increase 
and rainfall variability are the most relevant climate change 
impacts. 
Mitigations: Climate change is having a significant impact in 
the Brazilian semiarid, hence the PCRP is designed to 
address this risk by building resilience of communities to 
better face such conditions. The main risk pertains to 
prolonged drought, which could directly affect food supply, 
nutrition productivity and marketing. In this regard, the 
project is focused on implementing Climate Resilient

Productive Systems (CPRS) that are designed to increase 
water retention and improve the quality of agricultural 
soils. The project will provide strong technical assistance to 
deliver training and capacity building of beneficiaries as well 
as implement small-scale water harvesting technologies. 
The adoption of CRPS will also ensure that food availability 
and nutrition standards are maintained even during climatic 
shocks. 
Project Scope 
Project relevance  
Risk(s): The risk that the objectives and interventions of 
the project are not well aligned with national development 
or IFAD priorities, and/or are not sufficiently relevant or 
responsive to the needs and priorities of the intended 
target group throughout the project’s lifespan. 
Mitigations: In order to ensure project relevance, the 
design was carried out with strong consultations at various 
levels. Considering that before IFAD design the GCF 
Funding Proposal had to be elaborated this meant the 
project had a very intense preparation and field 
consultation. At the federal level, the Project will develop 
strategic partnerships with the ministries responsible for 
the corresponding thematic areas. A public consultation 
was organized during the project design phase bringing 
together more than 120 representatives from government, 
civil society organizations, public and private institutions. 
On this occasion, it was possible to collect 
recommendations and suggestions that were incorporated 
into the project design. Another specific indigenous 
consultation was also held. In addition, IFAD made 
consultations with states directly and through the Northeast 
Consortium of Governors (Consórcio Nordeste) and the 
Forum of State Secretaries of Northeast, which is a policy 
dialogue platform supported by IFAD since 2015. The 
Consortium visited IFAD HQ in November 2019. Two field 
missions were conducted, one in Bahia state and another in 
Pernambuco state, ensuring that views of farmers´ 
organizations were taken into account. 
Technical soundness  
Moderate 
Moderate 
Risk(s): The project represents an innovative approach to 
IFAD work in Brazil by establishing partnership with BNDES 
and a multi-state loan operation. It will also promote 
several technical innovations, in particular in CRPS to be 
implemented in Component 1. There is a risk that the 
proposed techniques will not be implemented correctly, as 
there are few examples of CRPS in the semiarid in family 
farms. This could create a delay in project implementation 
and/or achievement of results. 
Mitigations: To mitigate this risk, the following measures 
were put in place: i) The Dryland Adaptation Knowledge 
Initiative (DAKI) grant, approved in December 2019, will 
consolidate knowledge and methodology regarding the 
innovations of Components 1 and 2, and train potential TA

personnel. In addition, the ongoing AKSAAM grant will also 
support in bridging this knowledge gap; ii) TA will be 
composed of specialists who know the intervention regions 
and have gained knowledge from DAKI and AKSAAM; and 
iii) farmers networks will allow participation of larger size 
farmers that implement CRPS promoting exchanges visits 
to share practices and innovations. 
Institutional Capacity for Implementation and 
Sustainability 
Moderate

Moderate 
Risk(s): There is a risk of project delays, mainly in the first 
and second years, for four reasons: i) the process of 
preparing, negotiating and signing of sub-loan agreements 
between BNDES and selected states; ii) absence of 
complete teams in the state-level Project Management 
Units (PMU) and lack of knowledge of the project’s 
operative functioning by these teams; iii) turnover of key 
personnel, implementing agencies and governments; and 
iv) poor coordination among agencies. 
Mitigations:  
Delays in the on-lending process from BNDES to the states 
can be mitigated by an agile and transparent selection 
process and preparation of a standard financing agreement 
that would require negotiation mainly of the financing 
amounts for each state. 
The selection of a key team of consultants should follow 
IFAD’s guidelines on qualifications and the contractual 
arrangements IFAD allows, such as time contracts for 
consultant activities with monthly, measurable and reliable 
payments. The turnover of key project personnel can be 
considered of low risk when mitigated by an appropriate 
selection of professionals with training and experience, as 
well as by ensuring fair and reliable remuneration for 
performed activities. Priority will be awarded for states 
which have had past IFAD projects and are experienced in 
setting up PMU and TA teams.  
The use of several state-level PMUs (approximately 3) is a 
high risk for project execution because, in general, their 
regulations conflict with specific aspects of the activities 
necessary for efficient and transparent services. As a 
mitigation strategy, PMUs should be strengthened to carry 
out direct execution, empowering teams with specific 
training conducted by IFAD with the participation of state 
attorneys and representatives of interested parties. In the 
adoption of the Executing Entity, it is essential to ensure 
compliance with IFAD and BNDES guidelines in the 
contracts and provide specific training to support 
implementation. In case of states with previous experience 
of IFAD operations this will be greatly facilitated. 
In addition, the financing scheme involves IFAD, GCF, 
BNDES and states augmenting complexity of the operation. 
Institutional capacity risk will also be mitigated by strong 
IFAD supervision and implementation support missions 
ensuring that it is covered by technical aspects as well as

Moderate 
Risk(s): The risk that the project executing agency’s M&E 
processes and systems are weak or inefficient, resulting in 
a limited ability to monitor, validate, analyse and 
communicate results, capture lessons, and adjust 
implementation to seize opportunities and take corrective 
actions in a timely manner. 
Mitigations: IFAD over recent years has invested in building 
M&A capacity in the country, especially on its ongoing 
portfolio. This will leave a major legacy which will mitigate 
the M&E risk. Through the grant Programa Semear 
Internacional (PSI), IFAD first country M&E system was 
establish in Brazil: DATA.FIDA which is currently being 
adopted by the ongoing portfolio and will be used by the 
PCRP. In addition, IFAD and its project has gained 
expertise on critical areas related to M&E including base 
line surveys, MTR surveys, impact studies as well as 
project results survey conducted remotely. All this 
experience and capacity will be used to minimize M&E risk.

Low 
Risk(s): The risk that the Borrower’s regulatory and

with the laws) are inadequate to conduct the procurement 
in a manner that optimizes value for money with integrity. 
Brazil has a complete procurement legal and regulatory 
framework, consistent with IFAD’s one, including SBDs. 
Procurement processes are monitored by PMUs and state 
control agencies, while the CPMU monitors execution of 
Procurement Plans. Access to public information is 
expressly regulated and promoted. 
Mitigations: Non-compliance with legal covenants will be 
mitigated by strong IFAD supervision and implementation 
support missions as well as trainings and capacity buildings 
to the CPMU and PMU at state level 
Low

Accountability and transparency 
Low 
Low 
Risk(s): The risk that accountability, transparency and 
oversight arrangements (including the handling of 
complaints regarding, for example, SH/SEA and fraud and 
corruption) are inadequate to safeguard the integrity of 
project procurement and contract execution, leading to the 
unintended use of funds, misprocurement, SH/SEA, and/or 
execution of project procurements outside of the required 
time, cost and quality requirements. Brazil has an efficient 
complaints management system, however the latter is not a 2-tiered one 
and there is a certain level of corruption perceived in the country. There 
is a debarment system and an independent and competent local 
authority to investigate corruption allegations. 
Mitigations: IFAD will ensure that this risk is mitigated by 
making available channels to handle complaints. In

particular, during start-up missions for each state-level 
subproject, IFAD will analyse the complaints handling 
system and recommend a 2-tired mechanism. 
Transparency and accountability arrangements will be 
ensured with IFAD supervisions. Implementation of the 
project outside of required timeline or quality and cost 
requirement will be mitigated with IFAD support missions 
and adequate training. 
Capability in public procurement

Low 
Low 
Risk(s): The risk that the implementing agency does not 
have sound processes, procedures, systems and personnel 
in place for the administration, supervision and 
management of contracts resulting in adverse impacts to 
the development outcomes of the project. 
The project design foresees that state-level subprojects 
form a commission of bids, contracts and rendering of 
accounts. Officers are not yet selected, so it is not possible 
to assess experience of the staff and quality of documents. 
Procurement team has access to legal and regulatory 
framework by law. Procurement and financial management 
functions are separated. 
Mitigations: State-level PMUs need to expedite the hiring of 
procurement, contract, monitoring, and financial teams as 
soon as the project execution starts. Once projects become 
effective, IFAD and BNDES should receive the names of 
team members (state employees), the Terms of Reference 
(TOR) to hire supporting consultants and should train 
teams in the required thematic areas. The PIM (Annex 8) 
includes draft TORs of the key positions to speed 
contracting processes. 
Priority may be awarded for states which have past IFAD 
projects and are experienced in setting up PMU and TA 
teams and which already have experience with 
procurement. 
Public procurement processes 
Low 
Low 
Risk(s): The risk that procurement processes and market 
structures (methods, planning, bidding, contract award and 
contract management) are inefficient and/or anti-
competitive, resulting in the misuse of project funds or 
sub-optimal implementation of the project and 
achievement of its objectives. 
National procurement methods for all the three categories 
(goods. Works and services) are compliant with IFAD 
Guidelines and the first procurement plans has been 
prepared in consistency with the AWPB, using IFAD’s 
template. On the other hand, there is no regulation that 
provides for procurement people to participate in the AWPB 
process. Procurement processes and contract management 
comply with IFAD Guidelines as well. However, contracts 
are usually completed outside the contacted schedule and 
over the contracted price. 
Mitigations: IFAD will mitigate public procurement 
processes risks with strong supervision and implementation

Mitigations: (i) IFAD to perform FM assessments to the 
SIUs involved to identify weaknesses and required 
improvement actions; (ii) SIUs to build upon the pre-
existing operational structure of IFAD-supported projects; 
(iii) BNDES should provide professional personnel for 
financial management before the project effectiveness and, 
during project execution, should maintain this trained 
personnel working following IFAD’s FM, Audit and Anti-
Corruption Guidelines and with the Project Implementation 
Manual. BNDES will ensure that its key personnel conduct 
IFAD’s online capacity building training on Financial 
Management. Both IFAD and BNDES’ procedures and 
regulations will be shared to the states/subprojects through 
the PIM or other relevant documents; and (iv) Supervision

Substantial 
Risk(s): The complexity of the project’s funds structure 
may pose challenges to the flow of funds. Several entities 
(IFAD, GCF, BNDES, and the states) will fund the project 
through different financing instruments ruled by legal 
agreements. Participating entities will have to prepare, 
negotiate and sign the legal agreements, a process that is 
unlikely to complete simultaneously, risking funds not 
being available from the different sources as needed. 
Additionally, legal agreements relating to the GCF may 
prove to be particularly complex to negotiate, leading to 
the risk of disbursement delays. 
Mitigations: IFAD will have to make extra efforts (internally 
from various divisions and externally with authorities) to 
ensure that legal agreements are prepared, negotiated, 
and signed timely.

Community health and safety 
Risk(s): The COVID-19 epidemic may pose a risk to the 
project operations and to the health of the technical 
assistance (TA) teams and beneficiaries.  
Mitigations: To mitigate the risk, all TA teams will follow 
social distancing, health and safety protocols and will wear 
protective gear. In addition, they will provide guidance on 
basic hygiene practices. Online groups will reduce all 
unneeded physical interaction. If a vaccine is developed 
and available during project implementation, IFAD can 
coordinate with local health authorities to promote 
vaccination of the beneficiaries. Pilot IFAD experiences with 
remote TA and services will be reviewed and utilized during 
the project implementation. A specific Working Paper is 
included on the issue of COVID-19 and its relations to the 
PCRP. 
Labour and working conditions 
Moderate 
Low 
Risk(s): The risk that the project may cause exploitative 
labour practices (e.g. forced or child labour), gender based 
violence, discriminatory and unsafe/unhealthy working 
conditions for people employed to work specifically in 
relation to the project, including third parties and primary 
suppliers 
Mitigations: The project and especially its technical 
assistance (TA) teams will be selected taken fully into 
account issues related to labour and working conditions 
and it is planned that this will be part of their curricula in 
terms of capacity building. The project in fact will lead to 
enhance conditions and awareness in the area of labour

including financial intermediaries), resulting in 
misunderstandings or opposition by stakeholders, or 
duplication/inconsistencies between partners working in the 
same target area that may undermine project 
implementation and achievement of project development 
objectives. 
Mitigations: Lack of interest among potential beneficiaries 
due to little awareness of CRPS, fiduciary risks and financial 
guarantee may be a risk for project implementation. Field 
visits have shown that farming families are generally aware 
of the problems they endure in producing during a crisis, 
such as the severe droughts of recent years. They are 
interested in finding solutions to their various problems, 
starting with those related to agricultural production. An 
ample stakeholder consultation was performed during 
project design to make sure the needs of the families were 
adequately addressed in the project. In addition, TRIPs will 
be developed with the participation of the beneficiary 
communities. An FPIC plan will be implemented for 
Indigenous and Traditional Communities. And youth 
participation will be encouraged (at least 50%), since they 
are more open to experimenting with new practices.  
For some families, the poverty condition may be an 
obstacle to their full participation in project activities. Some 
men feel threatened by women’s empowerment and may 
not allow their wives to participate. The project will address 
this by working with the family’s immediate needs, such as 
food security, nutrition and health. The design was highly 
participatory and reflects the demands and needs of 
stakeholders.
