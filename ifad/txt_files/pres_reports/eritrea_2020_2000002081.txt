National context 
The State of Eritrea is at a turning point in its development trajectory after the 
signing of a peace agreement with Ethiopia in July 2018, which ended decades of 
conflict dating back to 1991. In the same year, the United Nations Security Council 
lifted international sanctions that had been in place for nine years. It is expected 
that the peace dividend now offers Eritrea the opportunity to prioritize economic 
and social development, and to enhance international cooperation. 
Eritrea’s real GDP growth dropped from 11 per cent in 2011 to 4.8 per cent in 
2016, and picked up slightly to 5.0 per cent in 2019, driven by public and private 
investments in the mining sector and in port infrastructure. Real GDP is projected 
to fall to -0.7 per cent in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.1 Agriculture and 
fisheries contribute only 17.6 per cent to GDP, although the sector employs 65–70 
per cent of the workforce. 
Eritrea’s Human Development Index score remains low at 0.43 (the country ranks 
182nd out of 189 countries). Its 2019 ease of doing business score placed it 189th 
out of 190 countries. Private sector participation in the economy is limited due to 
restrictive economic and financial policies. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
In line with the mainstreaming commitments of the Eleventh Replenishment of 
IFAD's Resources (IFAD11), the Integrated Agriculture Development Project (IADP) 
has been validated as:  
☒ Including climate finance  
☒ Nutrition-sensitive  
☒ Youth-sensitive 
IADP will devote significant resources to addressing climate vulnerability, adopting 
watershed management as the entry point for investments in climate-smart, 
productivity-enhancing interventions. The project will also create off-farm jobs for 
young people and women and promote nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices as 
well as dietary behaviour change at household and community levels. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
Since 1995, IFAD has been one of the few international development entities that 
has continued to finance agriculture in Eritrea. Earlier IFAD interventions focused 
on re-establishing the livelihoods of crisis-affected rural households, while more 
recent projects2 intervened in agricultural and fisheries development, with an 
emphasis on sustainable natural resource management. IADP proposes a package 
of interventions premised on watershed management as the starting point for 
agriculture development suited to rural Eritrea’s unique agroecological conditions 
and topography.  
B.  Lessons learned 
7.  Main lessons learned from past and ongoing interventions include:  
1 Global Economic Prospects, World Bank, June 2020.  
2 National Agriculture Programme, Fisheries Resource Management Programme. 
1 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
(i)  Access to water is critical to the resilience of farming activities. IADP 
will integrate watershed management as the entry point for enhancing 
productivity and making small-scale farming more resilient.  
(ii)  The lack of agribusiness orientation hampers the efficiency and 
sustainability of interventions. IADP will gradually introduce business planning 
to inform investments. 
(iii)  Institutional capacity gaps have constrained project implementation in 
Eritrea. The project will strengthen capacities, particularly in procurement, 
financial management (FM) and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 
II.  Project description 
A.  Objectives, geographical area of intervention and target 
8. 
groups 
Project goal and objective. IADP’s goal is to contribute to poverty reduction and 
food and nutrition security in rural households. The project’s development objective 
is to enhance smallholder agricultural production and productivity in a sustainable 
and climate-resilient manner and to improve rural livelihoods.  
9.  Geographical area of intervention. IADP will be national in scope, targeting all 
six Zobas (regions), with core interventions implemented in the four inland Zobas. 
The two coastal regions will mostly be supported through environment and 
ecosystem protection interventions. Activities, planned to cover approximately 40 
per cent of the 36 sub-Zobas, will be phased in according to: (i) capacities of local 
government agencies to manage additional area/activities, starting with watershed 
management interventions; and (ii) status of watershed treatment.  
10.  Target groups. IADP will directly benefit some 60,000 rural households, i.e. more 
than 300,000 people, of which 40 per cent will be women and 40 per cent youth. 
Priority beneficiaries will include: rural small-scale farmers involved in subsistence 
agriculture; farmers and young people interested in establishing farmers’ 
associations or cooperatives, or available to pilot micro enterprises; women; and 
youth (18–35 years), including demobilized soldiers. 
11.  Targeting strategy. The planning and implementation of activities will be 
based on a territorial approach. IADP will make use of direct targeting,  
self-targeting, facilitation (group formation, etc.) and empowerment measures. A 
social inclusion strategy will be developed, informed by assessments of the needs 
of women and youth. Methodologies such as the Gender Action Learning System 
will be employed. 
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
12. 
IADP has three components:  
(i)  Component 1. Integrated watershed management. This component will 
enable communities to plan and implement integrated land and water 
resource management in order to: (i) restore the hydrological and ecological 
functioning of watersheds; (ii) enhance the sustainability of existing land use; 
and (iii) improve resilience to climate shocks. Interventions will also support 
the production and dissemination of energy-saving technologies (e.g. cooking 
stoves, in selected watersheds). The expected outcome will be the 
strengthened environmental sustainability and climate resilience of poor rural 
people’s economic activities. 
(ii)  Component 2. Crop and livestock productivity and rural livelihood 
improvement. Building on the outcomes of component 1, this component 
aims to sustainably invest in practices that enhance agriculture and small 
livestock productivity. It also addresses the post-harvest handling of crops 
and aims to improve the resilience of farmers to climate change through 
2 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
climate-smart agriculture. The component will further support piloting micro 
agroenterprises. Based on viable business plans, these are expected to create 
about 6,500 jobs for young people. The expected outcome will be increased 
diversification of livelihoods and the strengthened resilience of communities. 
(iii)  Component 3. Institutional capacity-building and project support 
services. This includes: (i) increasing the institutional capacity of the actors 
(public and private sector/producers’ organizations) responsible for 
overseeing and/or implementing IADP activities; (ii) improving and/or 
reviewing and updating policies/strategies in selected subsectors to ensure 
their effective and structured development; and (iii) providing overall 
coordination to manage IADP efficiently and effectively. 
C.  Theory of change 
13. 
In line with its development objective, IADP will address the strategic constraints 
to crop and livestock production. This will be done through sustainable watershed 
management – the entry point for investments in climate-smart interventions that 
improve and diversify the diets of target populations. IADP will offer off-farm 
livelihood opportunities for women and youth, and strengthen the capacity of rural 
communities and implementing agencies. These investments will sustainably 
enhance smallholder agricultural production and productivity, and improve rural 
livelihoods in the targeted areas.  
D.  Alignment, ownership and partnerships 
14. 
IADP will contribute to the achievement of the following Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs): SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality), 
SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 15 (life on land). IADP is also aligned with IFAD’s 
Strategic Framework 2016-2025 and corporate priorities as well as the 2020-2025 
country strategic opportunities programme. The project further reflects national 
priorities, including: increasing agricultural, horticulture and livestock output; and 
creating farm enterprises that engage in highly productive, profitable agricultural 
value chains linked to domestic and international markets by 2023 (the Small and 
Medium Commercial Farmers Strategy, 2019-2023).  
15. 
16. 
IADP is aligned with various outcomes of all four pillars of the United Nations 
Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework 2017-2021. It should be noted that a 
new engagement strategy is being elaborated for 2021-2026. IADP implementation 
will explore the possibility of incorporating relevant elements of this new 
cooperation framework, once available.  
IADP will coordinate with IFAD’s ongoing portfolio as well as with development 
partners who support IADP-related initiatives, including the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, the African Development Bank and potentially 
the Green Climate Fund’s Great Green Wall Initiative.  
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
17.  Project costs are estimated at US$46.6 million to be disbursed over six years. All 
three project components count in part as IFAD climate financing. IFAD climate 
adaptation finance in the project amounts to US$19.4 million, which represents 
52 per cent of total IFAD funding.

Financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
IFAD will provide US$37.05 million through the IFAD11 cycle. Under the Fund’s 
new Debt Sustainability Framework, Eritrea is eligible to receive 80 per cent of that 
amount as a grant, and 20 per cent as an optional loan on highly concessional 
terms.  
20.  The Government’s contribution is estimated at US$4.9 million, of which US$3.5 
million as tax and duty waivers, in addition to US$1.4 million as the salaries of 
some project staff.  
21.  Beneficiaries will contribute in-kind, notably through labour and construction 
materials for watershed management and dam construction. Beneficiary 
contributions are preliminarily valued at US$4.7 million, or 22.7 per cent of the 
total value of works under expenditure category 1. 
22. 
Disbursement 
IADP will receive IFAD funding over six years. Disbursement will depend on budget 
execution and timeliness of procurement processes. Judging by ongoing projects, 
disbursement risk is assessed to be high. Main disbursement categories will be for 
works, goods, services, inputs and training. Operational procedures for these 
categories of expenditure, including criteria for providing goods, inputs and 
equipment to beneficiaries, will be fully clarified in the project implementation 
manual.  
23.  Training foreseen in the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B) will need to be 
supported by training, workshop and meeting plans and benchmarked against 
lessons to determine effectiveness and efficiency. Recurrent costs represent 4 per 
cent of the overall project and are mainly financed by the Government in the form 
of salaries. Support services provided to ensure the project reaches its 
development goal have been classified as investment costs given the longer-term, 
institutional capacity-building objective.  
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
24.  Based on the objective, results framework and component structure, the project is 
expected to generate the following benefits: increased yields; reduced land 
degradation and soil rehabilitation; increased resilience to climate change due to 
5 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
water management and irrigation investments; enhanced food security and rural 
poverty reduction.  
25.  The economic analysis shows that IADP is economically viable. The analysis period 
is 20 years to account for the phasing and gestation of the proposed interventions. 
The economic rate of return for the overall project is equal to 19.04 per cent and 
the net present value equals US$59.9 million. IADP is sensitive to changes in some 
of the model’s variables. The risks factored in the sensitivity analysis include 
weather variations, potential protracted procurement delays and generally weak 
implementation capacity, and prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Exit strategy and sustainability 
26.  Exit strategy. IADP’s exit strategy is embedded in the strategic approach of 
working directly with administrative bodies and community leaders at the national, 
Zoba, sub-Zoba and Kebabi (village) levels. By the fourth year of IADP, the 
communities and producers’ organizations will have taken full responsibility for 
planning and implementing watershed interventions as well as operating and 
maintaining production infrastructure. The project will hand over major 
infrastructure and equipment to the community together with a management plan 
and comprehensive operations and management training.  
III.  Risks 
A.  Risks and mitigation measures 
Table 4 
Risks and mitigation measures  
Main risks 
Mitigation measures 
Country context. Institutional capacity gaps and 
inadequate policy framework, and limited participation of 
private sector in agriculture. 
IADP builds on the National Agriculture Plan’s (NAP’s) 
foundations and will seek to strengthen capacities and 
policy frameworks in the implementing agencies of the 
Ministry of Agriculture. IADP will gradually integrate 
business planning into project investments. 
55.  Environment and climate context. Poor spatial and 
temporal distribution of water as well as total scarcity of 
rainfall in Eritrea, with over 90 per cent of the country 
receiving less than 450 mm per annum. 
Component 1 is built around integrated water resources 
management to restore the hydrologic and ecological 
functioning of watersheds, enhance the sustainability of 
existing land uses and improve lands’ resilience to climate 
shocks.  
Financial management (FM). Inadequate internal 
control and financial reporting systems.  
FM requirements will be reflected in legal covenants and 
technical assistance foreseen for first two years. 
Procurement. Lack of acceptable national legal and 
regulatory framework, procurement delays, limited 
procurement capacity. 
IFAD’s Project Procurement Guidelines, Procurement 
Handbook and standard procurement documents will apply, 
with continuous provision of technical assistance (TA) and 
training.

B.  Environment and social category 
27.  Project interventions include: construction of soil and water conservation 
structures; small-scale irrigation; drought-tolerant crops; forage and livestock 
breeds; tree planting along hill slopes; rangeland management; and establishment 
of enclosures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide carbon sinks. The 
project has been preliminary classified as environmental and social category B 
since the size of the irrigation schemes will not result in any loss of ecosystem 
services, nor have significant negative implications over a broader area.  
28.  The project will respect the environmental and social safeguards required by the 
Government and IFAD. It will abide by the 2017 Eritrean Environmental Protection, 
Management and Rehabilitation Framework, the 1999 National Environmental 
Assessment Procedures and Guidelines, and the 2008 Environmental Assessment 
Procedures and Guidelines for Agricultural Projects. An environmental and social 
management framework (ESMF) reflecting these requirements with respect to 
planned project activities, together with a free prior and informed consent 
implementation plan will guide the project during implementation. The ESMF was 
developed as part of project preparation.  
C.  Climate risk classification 
29.  Based on the analysis documented in the Social, Environmental and Climate 
Assessment Procedures of IFAD, the project’s climate risk is preliminarily classified 
as high. Risks will be mitigated by increasing the ability of the affected 
communities to adapt to environmental and economic variability and long-term 
changes. A climate risk vulnerability analysis has indicated the main risk as 
increased temperatures and extreme temperatures, and reduction in precipitation, 
which will all be addressed under IADP.  
D.  Debt sustainability  
30.  Eritrea has not undergone a debt sustainability analysis from the World Bank or the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), but is classified as a low-income country 
eligible for the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. IMF staff completed an 
Article IV mission in May 2019, and a report is expected to be published soon. 
According to the World Bank’s Macro Poverty Outlook (spring 2020), total public 
debt, including external arrears, shrank to an estimated 232 per cent of GDP in 
2019 from 291 per cent in 2017, driven by persistent primary surpluses and debt 
relief. External public debt declined by 10 per cent to 52 per cent of GDP (or 
US$1.1 billion) in 2018–2020, mainly due to debt relief by the Abu Dhabi Fund for 
Development. Meanwhile, domestic debt dropped to 179 per cent of GDP in 2019 
(US$3.8 billion) from 208 per cent in 2018, due to net repayments of Treasury 
bonds to banks and of central bank advances to pay part of public sector wages. 
However, the 2020 African Economic Outlook highlights that Eritrea is already at 
high risk of debt distress and that the latter could culminate in a drop in the 
sovereign rating and a rise in interest spreads, constraining growth. Given the 
dominance of state-owned enterprises and their dependence on state financing, 
spillover effects of sovereign debt on these entities could reduce output. 
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Project management and coordination 
31.  Project implementation arrangements. IADP will to a large extent emulate the 
existing structures of the NAP, although technical component leads will be 
introduced in IADP. The project will be implemented within the Government’s 
decentralized institutional framework, comprising the Ministry of Agriculture 
technical departments at national level, and their decentralized structures, 
including the branches and units of Zobas and sub-Zobas, as well as Kebabis. The 
Ministry of Agriculture will be the lead executing agency.  
7 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
Project coordination framework 
32.  A national project coordination office (NPCO) will be established under PSD. The 
NPCO will ensure day-to-day management of the project and will be headed by a 
project coordinator. The NPCO structure will include technical component leads and 
the engagement of TA as needed.  
33.  Zoba project coordination offices will be established in each of the six Zobas to 
coordinate project implementation. Planning and implementation committees, set 
up in every Kebabi and headed by the Kebabi administrator, will coordinate 
planning and implementation of project activities at that level.  
34.  The national project steering committee of NAP will be re-established under IADP 
to ensure cross-sectoral coordination as well as strategic oversight of project 
implementation across the six Zobas. Its main function will be to ensure that the 
project is implemented within the national policy and strategy framework. It will 
also provide strategic guidance and resolve critical implementation bottlenecks.  
35.  Zoba project coordination committees will oversee operations at Zoba level. The 
committees will meet on a quarterly basis. Chaired by the Zoba governors, they 
will also include the directors of Zoba administration departments and heads of 
agriculture divisions. The committees’ functions are similar to those of the national 
project steering committee at national level. 
Financial management, procurement and governance 
36.  Financial management. Overall responsibility for FM and procurement will lie 
with the Administration and Finance Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
while the finance units of the Zoba project coordination committees will be 
responsible for accounting, FM and procurement at the Zoba level. An assessment 
of proposed FM arrangements has been undertaken. The risk is assessed to be high 
at design, due to manual processes and inadequate staff capacity and oversight 
mechanisms. With the adoption of the mitigation measures, residual FM risk 
remains substantial at the outset, and will be reassessed during implementation.  
37.  Adoption of country systems will be limited as there is no integrated FM mechanism 
through which to report IADP expenditures. TA will be required for at least the first 
two years of implementation, to ensure: (i) that an appropriate control framework 
is adopted; and (ii) that finance capacity at NPCO and Zoba levels is built up, 
including strengthening internal and external audit mechanisms. Agreed FM risk 
mitigation measures will be reflected in legal covenants of the IADP financing 
agreement, and detailed procedures will be clarified in the project implementation 
manual. 
38.  Procurement. While the overall responsibility for procurement rests with the 
Administration and Finance Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, the NPCO 
procurement team will be responsible for ensuring compliance with IFAD’s Project 
Procurement Guidelines; Zoba project coordination committees will be responsible 
for carrying out procurement activities at the Zoba level. Capacity-building 
interventions will be guided by a capacity needs assessment, with regular 
implementation support missions and targeted training activities, including support 
on the use of IFAD’s standard procurement documents.  
39.  Governance. While the enforcement of good governance would be the primary 
responsibility of the Government of Eritrea, all IADP’s stakeholders will be made 
aware of the Revised IFAD Policy on Preventing Fraud and Corruption in its 
Activities and Operations. IFAD has zero tolerance towards fraudulent, corrupt, 
collusive or coercive actions in programmes and projects. IADP will also apply 
IFAD’s Framework for Operational Feedback from Stakeholders. Finally, IADP will 
comply with the IFAD Policy to Preventing and Responding to Sexual Harassment, 
Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.  
8 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
40. 
Project target group engagement and feedback, and grievance redress3 
IADP will align with IFAD’s Framework for Operational Feedback from Stakeholders 
and ensure beneficiary engagement in the entire project cycle from start-up to 
completion. An indicator for tracking beneficiary engagement and feedback has 
been included in the M&E system.  
Grievance redress 
41.  A project grievance and redress mechanism has been developed in the ESMF and 
the Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures of IFAD, and 
proposes recourse through a community-based route and formal legal procedures. 
The community-based grievance redress mechanism uses existing traditional 
structures and also facilitates grievance resolution at higher levels (including courts 
of law, where necessary).  
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communication 
42.  Planning. The M&E team, in close collaboration with PSD, will be responsible for 
the coordination of programming and preparation of the project’s AWP/B. AWP/Bs 
will be key instruments for implementation and operational control. PSD will 
consolidate AWP/Bs from all implementing partners, including at the community 
level. The project will adopt multi-year, results-oriented planning, linked with 
achievement of its development objective.  
43.  Monitoring and evaluation. PSD will coordinate M&E processes, reporting, and 
knowledge management. PSD will be responsible for preparing consolidated  
six-monthly and annual progress reports, conducting outcome surveys and carrying 
out thematic studies. A baseline study will be undertaken during the first year to 
provide a benchmark for assessment of outcomes and impact. The survey will 
include data for tracking progress on mainstreaming themes.  
44.  Knowledge management and learning will serve as the foundation for 
replication of successes, provide the analytical basis for resolving challenges, and 
help to adapt activities to changing social and economic circumstances in the target 
areas. A knowledge management action plan will be prepared to identify knowledge 
gaps, and document and disseminate knowledge using various communication 
tools (Ministry of Agriculture newsletter, brochures, websites and radio). South-
South and Triangular Cooperation and exchange visits will be integrated into the 
knowledge management and learning strategy. Knowledge management will also 
inform the development of policy frameworks for food safety, the seed sector and 
animal health.  
45.  Communication. IADP will develop a strategic communication plan for 
communication products targeting specific groups such as the general public and 
donors to increase awareness of the project and its results. Improved 
communication will support the project’s social inclusion interventions and improve 
group engagement and feedback.  
46. 
Innovation and scaling up 
IADP’s key areas for innovation include: advanced irrigation technologies; 
cooperative development with a focus on promoting community-led 
agroenterprises for youth; energy-efficient cooking stoves; and community 
kitchens. Priority areas for scaling up will be: good practices and water use 
efficiency in irrigation; sustainable land and water management, conservation 
farming, and soil fertility; and Eritrea’s Minimum Integrated Household Agricultural 
Package approach adapted to IFAD’s mainstreaming priorities.

128-R-13.pdf?attach=1) for further details. 
9 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
C.  Implementation plans 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
47.  The project will build on NAP’s achievements, including its implementation 
structure, which will contribute to a seamless transition. Implementation readiness 
at start-up will include: (i) reappointment of staff, after performance evaluation, in 
accordance with updated terms of references; (ii) expedited procurement of an FM 
system and other related software; (iii) ESMF preparation, climate risk and 
vulnerability assessment upfront, as well as feasibility studies and capacity needs 
assessment; (iv) recruitment of key TA prior to project start-up.  
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans 
48.  Supervision. IADP will be supervised by IFAD and the Government of Eritrea 
through joint supervision missions.  
49.  Midterm review. This will be undertaken halfway through the project to ensure 
that IADP is on track to achieving its development objective. The midterm review 
will also be an opportunity to revisit key design elements (e.g. indicator targets) as 
required, since IADP’s design was finalized under COVID-19 guidelines.  
50.  Project completion. At the end of IADP’s implementation, the Government of 
Eritrea will be required to undertake a project completion review, in close 
coordination with IFAD. A beneficiary impact assessment will also be undertaken to 
inform the review.  
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
51.  A project financing agreement between the State of Eritrea and IFAD will constitute 
the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as 
appendix I. 
52.  The State of Eritrea is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD. 
53. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
VI.  Recommendation 
54. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a Debt Sustainability Framework 
grant to the State of Eritrea in an amount of twenty-one million one hundred 
thousand special drawing rights (SDR 21,100,000)  and upon such terms and 
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and 
conditions presented herein. 
RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly 
concessional terms to the State of Eritrea in an amount of five million two

Schedule 1 
Programme Description and Implementation Arrangements 
I. 
Programme Description 
1. 
Target Population. The Project/Programme shall directly benefit approximately 60,000 
rural households or more than 300,000 household members. Priority beneficiaries will be: a) 
rural smallholder farmers involved in subsistence agriculture, horticulture and small livestock 
keeping;  b)  farmers  and  youth  interested  in  establishing  farmers’  associations  or 
cooperatives or pioneer small and medium enterprises (SMEs); c) women, especially woman-
headed  households,  and  households  with  young  (0-5  years)  children,  with  priority  to 
malnourished children; and d) youth (18-35 years), including demobilized soldiers. 
2. 
Project/Programme area. The Project/Programme will be national in scope, targeting 
all  six Zobas (regions),  with  core  interventions  implemented  in  the  four  (4)  inland Zobas, 
while  the  two  (2)  coastal Zobas will  mostly  be  supported  through  environment  and 
ecosystem protection interventions.  Interventions  will cover  approximately 40 per  cent  of 
the  sub-zobas  (i.e.  36  sub-zobas).  In  view  of  the  varied  institutional  capacity  across  the 
different Zobas,  the  intervention  area will  be  expanded gradually,  using  a  phased 
approach to ensure effective and sustainable achievement of outcomes and impacts. Among 
other triggers the expansion will be determined by:  
 
level of readiness of the decentralized implementing entities in the Zobas to 
manage additional area/activities, starting from Component 1 on watershed 
management interventions, with gradual expansion to Component 2; 
  assessment of status of watershed treatment which will determine the appropriate 
entry point for interventions under Components 1 and subsequently component 2; 
 
impact assessment studies of NAP, which will provide guidance on the Zoba/sub-
Zoba capacities, experiences and gaps to mitigate potential implementation 
inefficiencies.   
3.   Goal. The goal of the Programme is to contribute to poverty reduction and food and 
nutrition security of rural households.  
4.  Objectives.  The Programme  development  objective (PDO)  will  be  to  enhance 
smallholder agricultural production and productivity in a sustainable way and improve rural 
livelihoods.  
5. 
Components. The Programme shall consist of the following Components:  
5.1    Component 1: Integrated Watershed Management – Given the poor spatial and 
temporal distribution, as well as the scarcity of rainfall in Eritrea, with over 90 percent of 
the total area receiving less than 450 mm per annum, soil moisture  deficiency is one of 
the  important  risk  factors  to  the  country’s  food  security.  To  address  this  challenge,  this 
Component  will  support  water-centred  interventions,  thereby  deploying  a  watershed 
management approach (in the context of integrated water resources management (IWRM) 
as the planning unit. The Component will finance activities required to plan and implement 
IWRM  to  restore  the  hydrologic  and  ecological  functioning  of  watersheds,  enhance  the 
sustainability of existing land uses and, improve its resilience to climate shocks. It will also 
support the production and dissemination of energy-saving technologies, especially stoves 
in  selected  watersheds.  The  expected  outcome  would  be  “Strengthened  environmental 
sustainability and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities”. 
5.1.1   Sub-Component 1.1. Development and Implementation of Participatory Integrated 
Watershed Management Plans  
5.1.2.1 
Sub-Component 1.2: Implementation of Watershed Management Plans  
5 
Appendix I 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
5.1.2.2 
Sub-Component  1.3:  Watershed  Restoration  and  Water  Management 
Infrastructure  
5.2  Component  2:  Crop  and  Livestock  Productivity  and  Rural  Livelihood 
Improvement – Building on the outcomes of the water-centred interventions in Component 
1, the aim of this Component is to sustainably invest in agriculture and livestock productivity 
enhancing interventions, post-harvest handling of agricultural commodities and improving 
resilience of farmers to climate change, through climate smart agriculture (CSA). The CSA 
and  livestock  technologies  and  good  practices  will  be  supported  and  implemented  in  the 
targeted areas as a starting point to then be scaled up, prioritizing key commodities. At least 
26,250 households would benefit from enhanced advisory and livestock services, improved 
access  to  production  assets  and  seeds,  and  nutrition-sensitive  agriculture  practices.  This 
component will support piloting of agro-SMEs, based on business plans, that are expected 
to  create  about  6  500  jobs  for  the  young  people,  in  line  the  focus  of  the  Eritrea  COSOP 
(2020-2025) to gradually move towards market-oriented production. The expected outcome 
will be “Increased diversification of livelihoods and resilience of communities”. 
5.2.1 Sub-Component 2.1. Access to Advisory Services 
5.2.2.  Sub-Component  2.2  Sustainable  Access  to  Inputs  and  Technologies  for  Enhanced 
Production and Post-harvest Management 
5.2.3. Sub-Component 2.3 Producers' Organizations and Cooperatives Support 
5.3. Component 3. Institutional Capacity Building & Project Support Services – This 
will  be  a  cross-cutting  component  servicing  the  technical  components  and  facilitating 
pathways  for  the  effective  implementation  of  planned  activities,  and  addressing  systemic 
institutional  capacity  gaps.  The  component  aligns  with  SO3  of  the  Eritrea  COSOP  (2020-
2025)  and  responds  to  the  need  to  strengthen  capacities. Accordingly,  it  will  aim  at:  a) 
augmenting the capacity of the institutions (public and private sector/farmer organizations) 
that will be responsible for overseeing and/or implementing the different IADP activities; b) 
facilitating the development and/or review and update of policies and strategies of selected 
subsectors  for  their  effective  and  structured  development;  and  c)  managing  IADP  in  an 
efficient  and  effective  manner  by  providing  overall  coordination,  including  planning  and 
implementation, financial management and control, procurement support, monitoring and 
evaluation, knowledge management, and progress reporting. It will also ensure liaison and 
linkage with all other relevant projects/programmes being implemented in the country that 
seek to address similar or related constraints. 
5.3.1. Sub Component 3.1 Institutional Capacity Building and Policy Support 
5.3.2. Sub Component 3.2 Project Management and the South-South Triangular Cooperation 
(SSTC)  
5.4. Component 4. Disaster Risk Reduction and Management –This is a “zero budget 
allocation” component. It is a response window to improve the project’s agility to respond to 
crisis/emergencies  declared  by  the  Government  that  have  significant  adverse  impacts  on 
IFAD’s target group, achievement  of project  objectives and the  overall viability of project 
intervention. The objective will be to avail funds that can be quickly drawn, hence giving the 
project adequate preparedness and timely response when adverse conditions manifest, such 
as  recurrent  weather  extremities  or  any  other  calamities,  such  as  the  recent  COVID-19 
pandemic.

Implementation Arrangements 
Lead  Programme  Agency.    IADP will  be  implemented within  the  Government’s 
6.  
decentralised  institutional  framework,  comprising  the  MOA  technical  departments  at 
national  level,  and  their  decentralized  structures,  comprising  of  the  branches  and  units 
of Zoba and Sub-zoba level, as well as at Kebabi level. The MoA will be the lead executing 
agency for the Programme, and will delegate the role of the lead implementing agency to 
the  Planning  and  Statistics  Department  (PSD).  It  will  liaise  with  the  other  participating 
ministries/institutions  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  to  steer  effective  Project 
implementation. 
7.   Programme  Oversight  Committee.    The  National  Project  Steering  Committee 
(NPSC) of NAP will be re-established under IADP to ensure cross-sectoral coordination as 
well as strategic oversight of project implementation in accordance with the set objectives, 
across the six (6) Zobas. Its functions will include: a) oversight of Project implementation; 
b)  ensuring  that  the  Project  is  implemented  within  the  national  policy  and  strategy 
framework;  c) approval of the AWPB; and d) providing strategic guidance and resolving 
critical implementation bottlenecks. The NPSC will be chaired by the Minister of Agriculture 
and include MoF, MoLWE and the six Zoba governors or their representatives, the Director 
of PSD of MoA will be the secretary. 
Zoba Project Coordination Committees (ZPCCs) will  provide  oversight  of  operations 
at Zoba level, review and endorse the Zoba AWPB implementation progress and financial 
reports before forwarding to PSD and NPCO for consolidation. The ZPCOCs will meet on a 
quarterly basis and will be chaired by the Zoba Governors and comprising, inter alia, the 
Directors  of Zoba Administration  Departments  and  Heads  of  Agriculture  Divisions.  Their 
functions are similar to that of the NPSC at national level. 
8.   Programme Management Unit.  National Project Coordination Office (NPCO) will 
be established under MoA’s Planning and Statistics Division (PSD); thus, the NPCO will be 
under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  PSD  Director.  The  NPCO  will  ensure  day-to-day 
management of the Project; it will be headed by a full-time Project Coordinator (PC), fully 
dedicated to IADP. The NPCO structure, as it is under NAP, will remain largely unchanged. 
However, the PC and all IADP-NPCO staff will largely be expected to be fulltime and fully 
dedicated  to  the  Project.  The  IADP-NPCO will  be  reinforced to:  a)  strengthen  technical 
coordination  across  project  implementers;  b)  improve  planning,  fiduciary  functions,  and 
M&E, and c) ensure compliance with environmental/safeguards and adherence to targeting 
and  social  inclusion  requirements.  The  IADP-NPCO  will  be  organised  into:  a)  three 
technical  teams  headed  by  component  heads  supported  by  sub-component  technical 
expert; b) planning and monitoring team, headed by a Senior M&E Officer, supported by 
planning,  M&E,  KM,  Social  Inclusion  and  Environmental  Monitoring  Officers;  and  c)  an 
administration  team  consisting  of  a  Senior  Procurement  Officer  and  Financial  Controller 
supported by 3 procurement assistants, an accountant and an assistant accountant. 
Zoba Project  Coordination  Offices  (ZPCOs) will  be  established in  each  of  the 
six Zobas,  to  coordinate  implementation  of  the  Project.  They  will  comprise  technical 
experts seconded from the Zoba branches. The ZPCO structure will mirror that of the NCPO 
at national level. The Zoba Administration will carry-out coordination and implementation 
responsibilities at Zoba level. At Zoba level, the Directorate General for Agriculture, Land 
and Environment will be responsible for implementation of the bulk of project activities, 
through  the  Local  Government  structure.  In  particular,  the  branches  of  Soil,  Water  and 
Irrigation;  Animal  Resources;  and  Crop  Development  will  implement  project  activities 
through  the  various  units  and  sub-zoba structures.  In  addition,  the  Agricultural 
Infrastructure branch of the Directorate General for Infrastructure Development will have 
an implementation role in relation to dam infrastructure development. Within each Zoba, 
the development process will largely be driven by the local communities through the Sub-
zobas and Kebabi administrations following the GoSE decentralised participatory planning 
7 
Appendix I 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
system, whereby Village Development Plans are consolidated into Kebabi plans, which are 
then  consolidated  into  Sub-zoba plans,  and  finally  then  into Zoba plans.  The  Sub-
zoba Agricultural  Divisions  will  provide  direct  supervision  of  the Kebabi-based  technical 
teams as well as prepare progress reports following Government guidelines. 
Planning  and  Implementation  Committee  (PIC) in  each Kebabi headed  by 
the Kebabi Administrator will coordinate planning and implementation of project activities. 
PIC will receive technical support from the Sub-zoba line agencies. 
the Zoba administrations, 
Implementing partners.  AED of MoA will be a core implementing entity as it has a 
9.  
mandate  for  implementation  of  national  resources  management,  catchment  treatment, 
irrigation development, horticulture and livestock development; agricultural extension and 
communication; value addition, agro-input supply. AED will provide technical backstopping 
implementation is 
to 
aligned with GoSE policy  and  strategy.  It  will  collaborate  with  the  RSD  and MoLWE in 
ensuring  that  agricultural  production  activities are  carried  out within  the  environmental 
guidelines  and  policies.  NSU,  under  AED,  in  collaboration  with Zoba seed  units,  will 
technically  backstop  private-sector  seed  growers  for  multiplication,  processing  and 
marketing of certified/improved seeds, as well as be responsible for development of the 
national  annual  seed  plan  and  development  of  specifications  for  procurement  of  these 
seeds.  The  Marketing  and  Credit  Unit  will  be  responsible  for  activities  related  to  input 
distribution. 
Project 
ensure 
that 
and 
the 
targeted  on 
following  subjects:  TLST, 
NARI will assume responsibility for adaptive research and strengthen collaboration with the 
AED 
IPM,  bio-pesticides,  organic 
fertilizers, rangeland management,  improvement  of  indigenous  poultry,  as  well  as  food 
safety and nutrition. Seed variety screening and multiplication of foundation and breeder 
seed,  will  be  supported  by  the  development  and  implementation  of  protocols  and  the 
decentralization of the  seed distribution system.  Implementation will happen at national 
level as well as through the Research Sub-Stations, as per the agro-ecological zones. 
Other key stakeholders will include: a) RSD – will support inspection services of food, feed 
seed,  pesticides,  drugs  and    vaccine  and  some  environmental  assignments,  through 
their Zoba Inspection  Departments  as  well  as  providing  quarantine  services  and  seed 
certification schemes; b) NAPHL – will work on food quality and safety, and start-up the 
capacity to produce vaccines, in particular for small ruminants and poultry; c) AFD – will 
foresee  the  financial  management  and  procurement  functions  of  the  Project;  and  d) 
Agricultural  Colleges  –  will  be  a  potential  partner  for  capacity-building  activities 
(Subcomponent 3.1). 
10.   Monitoring and Evaluation.  PSD will coordinate monitoring and evaluation processes, 
reporting,  and  knowledge  management.  PSD  will  be  responsible  for  the  preparation  of 
consolidated  6-monthly  and  annual  progress  reports.  A  baseline  study will  be 
undertaken during  the  first  year  of  Project  implementation  to  provide  a  benchmark  for 
assessment of outcomes and impact of the Project; the study will incorporate appropriate 
questionnaire to collect baseline data for tracking progress on mainstreaming themes (i.e. 
MDD-W)  following  IFAD  COI  standard  guidelines  and  Appendixes.  It  will  also  conduct 
impact  evaluation  and knowledge  management  activities,  production  of  annual  progress 
reports,  conducting the annual outcome surveys and implementation review workshops, 
carrying  out  special/thematic  studies,  Mid-term  review  (MTR)  and  Project  Completion 
Report (PCR). 
The  Project  will  adopt  a  results-based  management  and  check  systematically  the 
contribution of each planned activity to outcome achievement. IFAD will undertake periodic 
monitoring,  evaluation  and  supervision  Missions  to  assess  the  status  of  Project 
implementation and evaluate the Project’s direction with respect to its objectives, outputs 
and outcomes. IADP’s M&E strategy will be to establish an iterative process for identifying 
issues and problems to ensure that the Project focus is maintained and expected outcomes 
are  achieved.  This  will  rely  on  data  from  periodic  monitoring  within  the  context  of  the 
operational M&E framework, and on specific thematic surveys, such as adoption, household 
8 
Appendix I 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
and outcome surveys. The team will document achievements through reflection meetings 
with NPCO team, implementing agencies and beneficiaries. The reflection meetings shall 
be organized on a quarterly basis for NPCO, ZPCOs and implementing agencies. PSD will 
also  explore  innovative  ways  to  collect  qualitative  and  quantitative  data,  including  GIS, 
focus group discussions, structured interviews and longitudinal panels. This will guide the 
consolidation  of  input  and  output  data  provided  by  implementers  and  reporting  on 
efficiency of implementation. 
Quarterly, bi-annual and annual reports will be produced by the respective implementing 
agencies with formal reporting responsibilities to the NPCO; the NPCO will consolidate the 
different  reports  to  produce  a  Project-wide  report  for  submission  to GoSE and  IFAD. 
Reports will provide information such as: a) overview of intervention activities undertaken 
in the last quarter and cumulatively over the fiscal year; and b) progress and outputs in 
terms of the agreed M&E indicators, provide lessons learnt, and knowledge gaps identified. 
The reports will also seek to identify any constraints encountered so as to seek guidance 
(where needed) from Project management for addressing the constraints. The project will 
strengthen  MOA’s  M&E  capacity  (tools  and  methods)  for  data  collection  and  analysis  to 
enhance reporting of project results. 
The  above-indicated  monitoring  activities will  be  complemented by  frequent  monitoring 
meetings  between  the  NPCO  and  the  Minister  of  Agriculture,  as  well  as  field  visits  by 
members  of  the  NPSC.  IFAD  will  also  ensue  that  an  M&E  specialist  is  included  in  at 
least 1 mission  per  year.  The  NPCO  will  ensure  adequate  beneficiary  monitoring  at  the 
Zoba  level  to  address  potential  overlap  with  FREMP  and  other  development  projects  in 
target areas. 
11.   Knowledge  Management.    KM&L  will  serve  as  a  foundation  for  replication  of 
successes, provide the analytical basis to resolve challenges, and help to adapt activities 
to changing social and economic circumstances in the target areas. A KM action plan will 
be prepared to: a) identify knowledge gaps and prioritization of knowledge products to be 
developed; b) systematically document methods to ease the up-scaling of best practices 
in Eritrea or repackaging of innovative approaches developed  elsewhere; c) disseminate 
knowledge using various communication tools (MoA newsletter, brochures, websites, radio, 
FFS). Regular reflection workshops, drawing on M&E data to improve performance, will be 
held and information sharing mechanisms (internal and external) developed. The South-
South cooperation and exchange visits will also be integrated in the KM&L  strategy (see 
Subcomponent 3.3). 
Supervision – IADP  will  be  jointly  supervised  by  IFAD  and GoSE.  Supervision will  be 
seen as  a  continuous  process  including  joint  missions  with  the  Government,  as  well  as 
continuous desk review to ensure that implementation is on track. Missions will be used as 
an  opportunity  to  jointly  assess  achievements  and  lessons  learned  with  the  overall 
objective  of  ensuring  effective  project  implementation  and  increase  the  likelihood  of 
achieving the target objective. The composition of supervision and implementation support 
missions will largely be determined by the prevailing circumstances. To the extent possible, 
the composition of the supervision and implementation support team will be maintained to 
ensure  continuity.  Implementation  support will  be  provided through  technical  assistance 
especially on M&E and Procurement. 
Mid-Term  Review  (MTR) –  An  MTR  will  be  undertaken  midway  through  project 
implementation  and  will  evaluate  whether  the  project  is  on  course  to  achieve  the 
objectives. The MTR will be a key reflection moment to assess implementation performance 
and recommend adjustments to the project, as may be required.  The recommendations 
will  take  into  consideration  the  likelihood  of  achieving  the  project's  targets  during  the 
remaining implementation period and may modify these targets, if considered necessary. 
The MTR will also be critical considering that this design has been finalised under COVID-
19  guidelines  and  there  may  be  need  to  revisit  the  assumptions  of  the  project  since  a 
validation  design  mission  could  not  take  place.  The  MTR  will  also  consider  a  potential 
extension to the project if required.

Appendix I 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1 
Project Completion Plans – At the end of the IADP implementation, GoSE will be required 
to  undertake  the  Project  Completion  Review  (PCR)  exercise,  in  close  coordination  with 
IFAD, in order to report on the results achieved through project interventions. As part of 
completion  activities,  a  Beneficiary  Impact  Assessment  will  be  undertaken  and  findings 
used to inform the Project Completion Report. The main purposes of the completion review 
process are to promote accountability, reflect on performance and elicit lessons learned to 
inform  future  programme/project  design  and  to  define  an  appropriate  post-project 
strategy. The  learning  dimension  of  the  completion  process  will  be  used  by  both  IFAD 
and GoSE as  the  foundation for  improvements  in  future  programme/project  design  and 
implementation.  The  completion  review  process  will  also  be  critical  for  identifying 
opportunities for scaling-up best practices. 
12.   Programme Implementation Manual. A draft Project Implementation Manual (PIM) is 
included as one of annexes to the PDR (Annex 8). The PIM provides guidelines, procedures 
and  processes  that  are  to  be  followed  in  the  implementation  of  IFAD  funded  initiatives 
under IADP. As an annex to the PDR, the processes and procedures presented are to be 
read in conjunction with the relevant sections in the PDR. It is envisaged that at start-up, 
the NPCO will convene all the relevant implementing agencies and stakeholders to review, 
clarify,  refine  and  confirm  the  activities  and  processes  outlined  in  the  PIM,  and  therein 
finalise the PIM for submission to IFAD for No Objection. The PIM should give due attention 
to the relevant arrangements for implementing the Environment and Social management 
Plan (ESMP). It is emphasized that the PIM is a living document, which can be reviewed 
periodically during the lifetime of the project, based on lessons learnt, subject to approval 
by the Project Steering Committee and IFAD’s No Objection.

Integrated project risk matrix 
Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Country Context 
Political Commitment 
Inherent 
Residual 
Substantial  Moderate 
Moderate  Low 
Risk(s):  
If the peace treaty between Ethiopia and Eritrea does not hold, the country 
may remain in isolation, and further divert from the current development 
trajectory. This may impact on the Country’s ability to invest in agriculture 
and other development sectors, and mobilisation of counterpart funds 
Mitigations: 
• IADP will support investments that promote economic and social 
empowerment of the rural communities to enhance their resilience  
• Apply IFAD’s guidelines for accounting for in-kind contribution to fully 
capture the contribution of the Government and beneficiaries, in lieu of 
counterpart funds 
Governance 
High 
Substantial 
Risk(s):  
Insufficient accountability and transparency due to weak financial internal 
controls; gaps in financial reporting and lack of national legal regulatory 
framework for procurement to curb fraud and corruption.  
Inclusion of women and youth in decision making remains a challenge due 
to socio-cultural and generational norms 
Mitigations:  
• TA will be provided to build capacity in Financial Management and put in 
place internal control framework  
• IFAD's Project Procurement Guidelines, Procurement Handbook and 
standard procurement documents (SPDs) shall be used;  
• AFDB has just initiated a project to support the Government in the 
preparation of a framework for Public Procurement  
• SECAP and specific quotas for the inclusion of women and youth. IADP 
also includes self-targeting activities that are attractive to these social 
categories (women and youth).  
• An ESMF has been prepared which presents guidance on Free, Prior 
and Informed Consent (FPIC) 
Macroeconomic 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Eritrea relies heavily on services 
(58.9 per cent) and industry (23.5 per cent). Agriculture and fisheries 
contribute only 17.6 per cent, although the sector employs 65-70 per cent 
of the population. The agriculture sector continues to underperform, and is 
unable to meet the food demands of the population. Agriculture and 
fisheries provide only a minor contribution to economic growth due to 
persistent low productivity, lack of investments and vulnerability to 
frequent droughts.  
The 2019 Ease of Doing Business score of Eritrea is 23.1 and ranks 
Eritrea 189th out of 190 countries. Private sector participation in the 
economy is constrained by various economic and financial parameters. 
Consequently, Eritrean agriculture has difficulties to compete in the 
international markets combined with restricted cross-border movements of 
capital, goods and services. 
Mitigations:  
• IADP will support investments that promote economic and social 
empowerment of the rural communities to enhance their resilience  
• IADP will also focus on addressing demand from local markets and 
import substitution  
17 
Appendix III 
EB 2020/131/R.5/Rev.1  
Risk Categories and Subcategories 
Inherent 
Residual 
• IADP will gradually integrate business planning to inform investments  
• The resumption of relations with Ethiopia and neighbouring countries 
may promote intra-regional trade on agriculture commodities 
Fragility and security 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
Negative impact of emergencies on the economy and livelihoods - COVID-
19 & Desert Locust 
Mitigations:  
• IADP includes an un-costed component to address any potential 
disasters and emergency situations arising from the project.  
• IFADs Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF) will address short-term 
disruptions to food supply chains, to ensure that beneficiaries are in a 
position to absorb project interventions  
• Reallocations under NAP are contributing to address the Desert Locust 
emergency. The Government is also exploring biological pesticides, and 
developing technology to convert the desert locust into animal feed. 
Sector Strategies and Policies 
Policy alignment 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
-Limited coordination across sectors,  
-Enabling environment may not be conducive for the realization of the 
Small and Medium Commercial Farmers Strategy (SMCFS) with the goal 
to create by 2023 farm enterprises that engage in highly productive, 
profitable agriculture value chains linked to domestic and international 
markets. 
Mitigations:  
• Continuous engagement with GoSE on coordination on watershed 
management activities by FREMP and NAP when they converge in Zobas, 
and within the context of the UNCT  
• IADP is supporting the development of key policy frameworks that are 
critical to the implementation of the SMCFS including the translation of 
policies into regulations for the food safety and certification protocols; 
seed sector development policy; cooperative proclamation, animal health 
legislation; enabling conditions for engagement in market-oriented 
production and nutrition sensitive agriculture. 
Policy development & implementation 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
Despite policy level aspirations for the development of a productive and 
profitable agriculture sector and a very strong commitment by Government 
to the country’s development agenda, there are significant systemic gaps 
at the institutional and policy levels e.g. appropriateness of procedures 
and regulatory frameworks to guide the implementation of rural 
development projects (e.g. national procurement framework, limited 
technical and institutional capacities at all levels, inadequate financial 
management and M&E systems which impact on the ability to 
quantitatively demonstrate development impact. 
Mitigations:  
• Capacity needs assessment, which will inform capacity development 
interventions and the provision of specialised technical assistance. 
Partnerships with ASARECA, Africa Capacity Building Foundation and 
FAO will be explored.  
• Analysis of economic sustainability and value for money to underpin new 
investments;  
• Strengthen M&E systems to demonstrate viability or inadequacies of 
different policies/strategies.

• AFDB has just initiated a project to support the Government in the 
preparation of a framework for Public Procurement 
Environment and Climate Context  
Project vulnerability to environmental conditions 
High 
High 
Substantial 
Substantial 
Risk(s):  
Given the poor spatial and temporal distribution of water as well as total 
scarcity of rainfall in Eritrea, with over 90 percent of the total area 
receiving less than 450 mm per annum, soil moisture deficiency remains 
to be the single most important physical production related risk factor to 
ensure food security in the country  
The project takes place in the context of land degradation and over 
exploitation of woody biomass 
Mitigations:  
• Component 1 is built around integrated water resources management 
(IWRM) as the planning unit. It will finance activities required to plan and 
implement IWRM to restore the hydrologic and ecological functioning of 
watersheds, enhance the sustainability of existing land uses and, improve 
its resilience to climate shocks.  
• a high level of awareness by government and regular programs of 
community level terracing and afforestation, which will also be reinforced 
by project activities 
Project vulnerability to climate change impacts 
High 
Substantial 
Risk(s):  
The climate risk of the Project is preliminarily classified as “high”. Climate 
change and increased climate variability are severely affecting Eritrea, 
through its significant impact on crop and livestock production, upland fish 
farming and rural livelihoods 
Based on trends, it is likely that most of the project sites will be exposed to 
at least one season of very low rainfall over the life of the project 
Mitigations:  
• The climate risks will be mitigated by increasing the ability of the affected 
communities to adapt to environmental and economic variability, and long 
term changes. As per IFAD requirements, a detailed desk-based Climate 
Risk Analysis will be undertaken during the pre-implementation, including 
details of mitigating actions.  
• Some of the climate smart technologies to be promoted include: a) 
rainwater harvesting; b) drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties; 
c) drought tolerant forage and agroforestry fodder species; d) watershed 
conservation and management; e) afforestation ;f) mangrove rehabilitation 
and conservation; g) solar and other forms of renewable energy sources, 
and energy saving approaches etc  
• The project introduces an innovative approach to targeting, that takes 
into account the agro-ecological conditions and overall environment and 
climate suitability to the proposed interventions 
Project Scope 
Project relevance  
Moderate  Low 
Moderate  Low 
Risk(s):  
A national programme may result in resources (financial and technical), 
spread too thinly, which may negatively impact implementation and affect 
the achievement of the development objectives. 
Mitigations:  
• Phased implementation based on Zoba capacities, state of the 
watershed treatment and findings of the NAP impact assessment will be 
applied

Risk(s):  
Weak M&E systems and capacities to consolidate, analyse data and 
report on outcomes. Different reporting systems across the Zobas 
Mitigations:  
• Specialised Technical Assistance  
• Participation in PRIME training of project staff  
• Development of project-level M&E manuals and standardized 
approaches across Zobas  
• Focus on outcome surveys 
Procurement 
Legal and regulatory framework 
Substantial  Moderate 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
• Lack of acceptable national legal and regulatory framework ;  
• Lack of standard bidding documents ;  
• Weak contract administration and management;  
• Limited public access to procurement information also due to very weak 
ICT systems. 
Mitigations:  
• Lack of acceptable national systems means IFAD's Project Procurement 
Guidelines, Procurement Handbook and standard procurement 
documents (SPDs) shall be mandatory;  
• a highly competent, qualified and dedicated team will ensure compliance 
with procurement monitoring;  
• enable IFAD-financed projects to operate on a separate platform to 
government or for IFAD to ensure government’s systems are upgraded.

Accountability and transparency 
Inherent 
Residual 
High 
High 
Risk(s):  
• The Government of Eritrea has to date not confirmed the existence of a 
procurement complaints mechanism;  
• Transparency.org assigns a low country corruption perception index 
score (23);  
• lack of a 2-tiered system to handle complaints, a debarment system and 
an independent and competent local authority responsible for investigating 
corruption allegations. 
Mitigations:  
• IFAD can strongly encourage government through policy dialogue to 
address these shortcomings;  
• All procurement entities, as well as bidders, suppliers, contractors, 
consultants and service providers, shall observe the highest standard of 
ethics during the procurement and execution of contracts financed under 
IFAD funded Projects, in accordance with paragraph 84 of the 
Procurement Guidelines. The Revised IFAD Policy on Preventing Fraud 
and Corruption in its Activities and Operations shall apply to all projects, 
vendors and third parties, in addition to the relevant national anticorruption 
and fraud laws. Adoption of IFAD’s Standard Procurement Documents will 
mitigate the identified risk.

• support on preparation of bidding activities in compliance with IFAD’s 
requirements;  
• Government commitment to the recruitment of qualified project staff;  
• With the use of IFAD’s SPDs, the quality of documents should improve 
and be compliant with IFAD’s requirements 
Public procurement processes 
Moderate  Low 
Risk(s):  
• Procurement methods are consistent with IFAD Guidelines. However, 
the choice of procurement methods should be revisited where national 
market conditions warrant it;  
• While ICBs are advertised on UNDB, bidding documents for other 
procurement methods are shared with bidders in soft copy via a USB pen, 
but they are only available at the MoA offices;  
• Procurement plans are of low quality;  
• Lack of secure storing capacity;  
• Minutes of bid opening are not sent to bidders;  
• Contacts are entered into after bid validity has expired.  
• Contract awards are notified only to participating bidders and publicly 
advertised. 
Mitigations:  
• With the use of IFAD's SPDs and the Procurement Handbook, the quality 
of documents should improve and be compliant with IFAD's requirements;  
• MoA should publish all bidding documents on their website;  
• The use of IFAD’s procurement tools will mitigate many of the risks 
associated to Procurement Planning and Contract Administration;  
• It is recommended that adequate and secure archiving space is 
guaranteed for both bids and securities;  
21

website;  
• It is highly recommended that government hold bidders responsible for 
the performance of contracts and cash in performance bonds/guarantees. 
Financial Management 
Organization and staffing  
Risk(s):  
• Capacity gaps of finance staff at NPCO level  
• Weak capacity of finance staff at zoba level  
• Lack of clarity on IFAD’s procedures 
Mitigations:

Environment, Social and Climate Impact 
Biodiversity conservation  
Moderate  Low 
Moderate  Low 
Risk(s):  
There are pressures on biodiversity due to population pressures. There 
are protected natural reserves. 
Mitigations:  
There is a high level of inherent agro-biodiversity in production systems 
across Eritrea and the project intends to build on this for dietary diversity 
among other reasons  
Project land use planning will ensure awareness of and avoidance of 
areas of potential overlapping of project areas with protected areas of their 
immediate dispersal/buffer areas. 
Resource efficiency and pollution prevention 
Low 
Low 
Risk(s):  
The traditional production systems of Eritrea are resource optimizing and 
use minimal external inputs, including few if any inorganic fertilizers, 
pesticides or herbicides. In any case import costs make this prohibitive for 
the target group but the project should not exclude for high value crops 
23

Residual 
Mitigations:  
Project will explore the options of natural integrated pest management  
Green manuring will be practiced, while being cognizant of potential 
competing demands for these same materials  
A ESMF will include materials on banned substances in terms of 
pesticides and herbicides, which are in any case will controlled by 
MoA/Regulatory Services 
Cultural heritage 
Low 
Low 
Risk(s):  
There is little reason to believe that the project areas would be exposed to 
or put at risk any protected cultural heritage artifacts 
Mitigations:  
SECAP2020 will be made available to the PMU at both central and zoba 
levels 
Indigenous Peoples 
Low 
Low 
Risk(s):  
Eritrea does not recognize the concept of ‘indigenous peoples’ however 
there are various ethnic groups. 
Mitigations:  
The project targeting strategy has a focus on the vulnerable in each 
project area, which in turn is selected on the basis of multiple and explicit 
criteria. 
Community health and safety 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
There will be water retention structure rehabilitation and/or construction, 
the exact dimensions of which are still to be determined but are expected 
to be under IFAD SECAP thresholds 
Mitigations:  
The project will ensure that technically competent persons (engineers) 
participate in the identification of sites and that any construction is 
approved according to government regulations applicable and that the 
same will be clearly documented. These structures will be inspected upon 
each supervision by a qualified team member 
Labour and working conditions 
Substantial  Moderate 
Risk(s):  
The long standing national requirement of community labour contribution 
for several weeks a year might represent a risk but a larger risk of 
triggering IFAD labour related safeguards is the potential of conscript 
(universal national service) labour being used unremunerated or 
inadequately remunerated in infrastructure related activities either by 
contractors and/or as a government contribution 
Mitigations:  
The project is not expecting to invest heavily in infrastructure 
development, which significantly reduces exposure to this safeguard risk  
The government position is that national service is universal and that 
persons are deployed in a range of jobs throughout the civil service and 
economy  
The government has signed the relevant international treaties and 
regularly exchanges with ILO.  
IFAD will engage with ILO to potentially field joint technical assistance if 
relevant to this project  
Labour risk issues are also detailed in the ESMF

Mitigations:  
Improved fodder will reduce the already low level of GHGs. No 
deforestation or additional biomass burning will result from project 
activities 
Vulnerability of target populations and ecosystems to climate 
variability and hazards 
Risk(s):  
Note: this refers to the risk from the project in terms of inadvertently 
exacerbating the vulnerability of the population by promoting maladaptive 
practices.
