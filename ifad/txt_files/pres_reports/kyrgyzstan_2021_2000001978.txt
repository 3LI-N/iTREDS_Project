Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in  
paragraph 53. 
I.  Context 
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
1.  Geography. The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous, landlocked country of 199,951 
km2 bordering Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China. Ninety-four per cent 
of the territory is at an elevation of more than 1,000 metres, and 40 per cent is 
above 3,000 metres.  
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
Political system. Kyrgyzstan is characterized as a hybrid regime in the Economist 
Intelligence Unit's 2018 Democracy Index and is ranked 98th out of 167 countries. 
The country performs much better than regional peers as the only non-
authoritarian country in Central Asia. A referendum in December 2016 approved 
constitutional amendments that shifted significant powers from the presidency to 
parliament and the prime minister.  
Economy. Kyrgyzstan maintains strong relations with Russia and is a member of 
economic and military alliances: the Eurasian Economic Union and the 
Collective Security Treaty Organization. In recent years, relations with China have 
also improved considerably, and China surpassed Russia as Kyrgyzstan’s most 
important economic partner in 2013 according to the International Monetary Fund. 
The economy is vulnerable to external shocks owing to its reliance on one gold 
mine, Kumtor, which accounts for about 10 per cent of GDP, and on worker 
remittances, equivalent to about 27 per cent of GDP in 2018. With an average 
gross national income per capita of US$1,130,1 Kyrgyzstan is classified as a lower-
middle-income country. 
Social context. Kyrgyzstan is home to 6.4 million people, 66 per cent of whom 
live in rural areas and depend primarily on agriculture and livestock for their 
livelihoods, along with remittances. The rural areas remain underdeveloped, with 
few off-farm jobs, as reflected in the official statistics recording higher rural than 
urban unemployment rates. Life expectancy for men is 67.2 years and for women 
75.4 years. In 2014, the average household size was 4.3 members overall, and 5.3 
members for rural households. The share of woman-headed households among all 
households is quite high at 34 per cent. The majority of households (69.1 per cent) 
are headed by persons who indicated Kyrgyz as their mother tongue; Uzbek was 
indicated in 12.2 per cent of cases, Russian 14.5 per cent and other languages  
4.2 per cent. 
Stage in transition and presence of fragility. With a country policy and 
institutional assessment score of 4.0 in 2017, Kyrgyzstan does not classify among 
the most fragile countries. Revolutions in 2005 and 2010 led to the overthrow of 
the incumbent presidents, who subsequently fled the country. Political stability is 
somewhat uncertain. Kyrgyzstan is not on the IFAD list of fragile countries as of 
2018, but is among the low-income food-deficit countries according to the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (2019). Climate change 
projections indicate that Kyrgyzstan will be increasingly affected by higher 
temperatures and rainfall that is more variable, as well as more hazard-prone. 
Droughts could become more frequent and prolonged in summer and floods 
(including glacial lake outburst floods) and landslides more frequent in winter.  
6. 
Poverty, food security and nutrition. Kyrgyzstan ranks 122th of 189 countries in 
the 2017 Human Development Index with a value of 0.672. Poverty in the country 
1 2017, Atlas method. 
1 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
7. 
is high: about 25 per cent of the total population lives below the poverty line; 
approximately 65 per cent of the poor live in the rural areas; and approximately 80 
per cent of the population is vulnerable to poverty. Poverty is closely related to 
food insecurity. In 2015, the population as a whole spent an average of 38 per cent 
of their income on food, while the share of income spent on food by the poorest 
groups was 74 per cent, demonstrating that poor households are more vulnerable 
to food insecurity. Dietary energy consumption by the poorest groups stood at  
13 per cent, considerably lower (by 35 per cent) than for wealthier groups. In 
2015, 6 per cent of the country’s population was undernourished.  
Smallholder agricultural and rural development context. Agriculture 
accounted for 12.3 per cent of GDP in 2017 (compared to 34 per cent in 2002) and 
employs 26.5 per cent of the total labour force. In rural areas, it remains the major 
source of employment and produces an annual value added of US$1,521 per 
worker (in constant 2010 United States dollars). Smallholder production makes up 
98.5 per cent of agricultural output. Given the mountainous topography, 
permanent cropland is 0.4 per cent and arable land approximately 7 per cent of the 
total land area, and thus Kyrgyzstan depends on imports of basic foods, especially 
wheat. Livestock therefore plays a crucial role, both in food security and as a safety 
net for the rural poor population. However, productivity is below potential and 
livestock-raising communities remain fragile, having few assets and limited 
economic opportunities to mitigate or adapt to natural disasters and the effects of 
climate change. 
8.  National strategies and policies. The overall framework for development in 
Kyrgyzstan is guided by the National Development Strategy 2018-2040 (NDS). The 
overall goals of the NDS are to establish a state governed by the rule of law, 
ensure national unity as a prerequisite for preserving statehood and address social 
issues and challenges. Specifically for the agricultural sector, the NDS calls for 
using Kyrgyzstan’s comparative advantages in terms of geography and climate to 
become a leading supplier of high-quality ecological and pure organic agricultural 
production for the regional markets and the markets of the Eurasian Customs 
Union. The strategy envisions farmers participating actively through cooperatives 
and other groups to add value to their produce and raise their incomes. The main 
development focus in the sector is on improving competitiveness on export 
markets, in addition to introducing international systems for quality control of 
production and processing. The Government’s Strategy for Agricultural 
Development 2017-2022 is intended to increase exports by introducing new 
technologies and innovative products and providing support to meat and dairy 
value chains. Gender equality is promoted by the National Strategy for Gender 
Equality. Kyrgyzstan ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change and submitted its intended nationally determined contribution in 2015.  
9. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
In line with Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD's Resources mainstreaming 
commitments, the Regional Resilient Pastoral Communities Project (RRPCP) has 
been validated as: 
☒ Including climate finance; 
☒ Youth-sensitive. 
10.  The Law of the Kyrgyz Republic on Youth Policy (2009) defines young people as 
those 14 to 28 years of age. Two thirds of the country’s young people live in rural 
areas and there is widespread migration both to urban areas, such as Bishkek and 
Osh, and abroad in search of work. Lack of employment is by far the biggest 
concern among rural youth. They are affected by limited economic opportunities, 
poor access to public services and limited opportunities to voice their needs. Young 
women face higher unemployment rates than young men, and are mainly stay-at-
home mothers.  
2 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
11.  Environment and climate. The two main environmental challenges to be 
addressed by the project are degraded pasture resources due to poor management 
and climate-induced degradation; and climate change. More than 40 per cent of 
agricultural land is seriously degraded, and over 85 per cent of the total land area 
is exposed to erosion. Temperatures are projected to increase by two to three 
degrees by mid-century, and precipitation by 12 per cent in the west and 18 per 
cent in the north-east. Historic rainfall data show a trend towards more 
precipitation in general, with greater seasonal variability and a marked reduction in 
summer, the main grazing period. The project is intended to induce behavioural 
change around the sustainable management of pasture and forest resources by 
integrating forest and rangeland resources under a single ecosystem management 
framework, and by introducing climate-resilient measures to be implemented at 
the community, district and central levels.   
12. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
IFAD has accumulated vast experience over more than 20 years of engagement in 
Kyrgyzstan. Promoted by the World Bank and IFAD, the Pasture Law approved in 
January 2009 started an effective process of reform, in addition to extensive 
support through the IFAD-financed Livestock and Market Development Programme, 
phases 1 and 2, which has been assisting pastoral communities in five of the 
country’s seven regions since 2013. While the reform has achieved substantial 
results in terms of the empowerment of rural pastoralist communities, it has failed 
to establish an effective integrated management framework, especially with regard 
to forestland and forest resources, typically located adjacent to rangelands.  
13.  Livestock production is important for smallholder production, as indicated above, 
but also for the country’s exports. When Kyrgyzstan joined the Eurasian Economic 
Union, the country gained an opportunity to access the vast markets of Russia and 
Kazakhstan. Yet it remains challenged by limited capacity to adhere to food safety 
standards. Based on its experience in the country, IFAD has a comparative 
advantage in working with rural communities and promoting policies relevant to 
livestock production.  
B.  Lessons learned  
14.  The key lessons learned from past and ongoing IFAD operations and those of other 
donors in the country are as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The transformation of pasture and forest resource management from a 
centralized system to a user-based tenure system is under constant 
challenge. It is critical to provide continuous support to uphold equity-based 
principles in policy, legislation and practices; 
Many of the issues relating to rangeland and forest management at district 
level lack an integrated coordinated response mechanism;  
Traditional smallholder livestock-rearing approaches and mentalities need to 
be addressed through engagement at the community level to optimize the 
income generated from livestock;  
Community demand for pasture infrastructure investments is on the rise;  
Actively engaging women through targeting and support measures has 
proven transformative and effective in delivering sustainable impact;  
Successful animal disease control and improved food safety require intensive 
public awareness efforts and strong logistical coordination;  
While there are several coordination mechanisms available in the country, 
there is a lack of technical capacity and limited inter-ministerial coordination 
between the State Agency on Environment Protection and Forestry (SAEPF), 
the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Regional Development 
3 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
(MoA), the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES), the State Agency for 
Local Self-Government and Inter-Ethnic Relations (SALSGIER), and local self-
government bodies; and  
 
Experiences with value chain development indicate that smallholders can 
increase their milk and meat yields provided they have satisfactory access to 
formal markets, remote pastures and water, and reduced exposure to 
livestock diseases.  
II.  Project description 
A.  Project objectives, geographical area of intervention and 
target groups 
15.  The goal of the RRPCP is to contribute to rural poverty alleviation in the country 
through increased resilience and incomes and enhanced economic growth in rural 
farming communities. The development objective is improved livestock and pasture 
health and productivity, and enhanced climate resilience of pastoral communities, 
reflected in improved and equitable returns to pastoral farmers. The project 
addresses the main drivers of rural poverty and food insecurity. The Government of 
Kyrgyzstan and IFAD, in the country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP), 
have identified increasing smallholders’ equitable and sustainable returns and 
increasing smallholders’ climate resilience as the key priorities for the future IFAD 
portfolio in the country, to which the RRPCP goal and development objective 
directly contribute.  
16.  The RRPCP also supports IFAD's Rural Youth Action Plan 2019-2021, which calls for 
enhancing the impact of IFAD’s investments on achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The project has a duration of five years, and is 
expected to reach at least 557,000 rural households organized in 454 pasture user 
unions (PUUs) and 141 forest user associations and 200 value chains. The project 
area is countrywide. The target groups are: (i) households practising mobile 
extensive livestock rearing; (ii) households extracting forest products;  
(iii) households producing fodder; and (iv) rural women and youth. Targeting will 
be based on the existence of a village vision or the ability to create one, livelihood 
fragility and social vulnerability, in line with the mainstreaming themes as 
described in paragraphs 10 and 11.  
B.  Components, outcomes and activities  
17.  Component 1 – Sustainable community-based integrated forest-rangeland 
ecosystem management. Component 1 will concentrate on behavioural change 
in the sustainable management of pasture and forest resources, in the context of 
increasing livestock numbers and a changing climate. It includes independent 
monitoring and the compilation and execution of evidence-based integrated plans 
to promote a climate-resilient economy and rehabilitate degraded resources. By 
integrating forest and rangeland resources under one ecosystem management 
framework, component 1 introduces a significant upgrade in the institutional 
arrangements for the pasture management approaches already supported by the 
previous IFAD portfolio. The outcome is climate-resilient integrated forest-
rangeland ecosystems that are sustainably managed. As a measure of success, 
3.68 million ha of pasture and forest land (50 per cent of pastures under PUU 
management) will be brought under sustainable and climate-resilient management 
practices.  
18.  Component 2 – Strengthening the food safety system. The RRPCP will 
strongly promote a shift from livestock quantity to livestock quality. The project will 
pilot the use of public-private partnerships in ecosystem-based natural resource 
management, and will leverage private sector investments by creating an enabling 
policy and institutional environment for green investments and climate-resilient 
value chains that will provide economic incentives for diversification and enhanced 
4 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
efficiency and productivity of existing economic activities in the highly degraded 
target areas. In terms of outcomes, the country’s capacity for food safety will be 
strengthened, and smallholder livestock farmers will produce safe products for 
national and export markets. Ultimately, the project is expected to bring a 15 per 
cent increase in the value of official exports of livestock and livestock products 
compared to the rolling average of the previous five years. 
19.  Component 3 – Climate-resilient value chains for women and youth. This 
component will promote low carbon and climate-resilient value chains to enhance 
ecosystem health and build the resilience of local communities, with a focus on 
poor women and youth, especially young women, who face higher unemployment 
rates. This component will support selected value chain actors to move towards 
greener and more resilient operations, and greater transparency and 
competitiveness for marketed products. This shift will be achieved through greater 
value chain integration, market-driven certification and robust marketing 
strategies. The outcome will be access to remunerative markets by poor women 
and youth. As a measure of success, 4,500 rural women and youth will report an 
increase of at least 30 per cent in their incomes from diversification. 
20.  Component 4 – Project management. The component provides for the overall 
management of the project by the Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit (APIU) 
of the MoA. 
C.  Theory of change 
21.  Livestock ecosystems are trapped in a vicious cycle of productivity collapse: 
overgrazing and degradation cause lower levels of available forage, which reduces 
animal productivity, causing households to own more animals to compensate for 
productivity declines, which in turn leads to more degradation. 
22.  The target groups hold the keys to sustainable management of forest-rangeland 
ecosystems: better grazing and herd management, forest conservation and 
production of sufficient fodder needed to bridge feed shortages in winter.  
23.  The RRPCP will leverage this capability by setting up an integrated management 
framework for pasture and forest resources, improving production systems and 
processing standards, and opening up opportunities for diversification. While 
placing sustainable management at its core, RRPCP will shift the livelihood 
strategies of pastoralists towards diversified income sources, and from traditional 
mobile pastoralism to commercially oriented mobile livestock-keeping for export, 
resulting in improved pasture conditions, increased productivity and higher-value 
produce.  
D.  Alignment, ownership, and partnerships 
24.  Alignment with the SDGs. The project will build livelihood resilience, improve 
smallholder and pastoral productivity, and strengthen market participation, all of 
which will contribute to achieving SDG 1 (no poverty). The project will strengthen 
the cash income-generating capacities of vulnerable groups and focus on 
smallholders, thus contributing towards SDGs 5 and 10 (gender equality and 
reduced inequalities). Healthier forest-rangeland ecosystems will sequester higher 
amounts of carbon and are also more resilient, contributing to the achievement of 
SDG 13 (climate action). Improvements in grazing will restore grassland and 
reduce deforestation, contributing towards SDG 15 (life on land). Profits from the 
livestock sector remain largely unrealized, while employment returns to investment 
in livestock are high because of high sector growth rate, labour intensity and 
diverse employment opportunities, so the project will contribute towards SDG 8 
(decent work and economic growth). By providing opportunities for viable rural 
livelihoods and using local resources, the project will contribute to SDGs 11 and 12 
(sustainable cities and communities, and responsible consumption and production). 
Finally, the project will promote partnerships between the Government, the private 
5 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
sector and civil society through government assistance to small businesses, thus 
contributing to realizing SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals). 
25.  Country ownership and alignment with national priorities. The project’s 
close alignment with and support for the Government’s policies, regulatory 
framework and strategies will ensure strong country ownership, specifically the 
NDS and action plan 2017-2022 and the United Nations Development Assistance 
Framework (2018–2022) for Kyrgyzstan. This project is fully aligned with the 
Government’s draft Strategy for Agricultural Development 2017-2022. In 
particular, the project supports the strategy’s objective to increase exports through 
the introduction of new technologies and innovative products, and the strategy’s 
emphasis on providing support to meat and dairy subsector value chains.  
26.  Alignment with IFAD policies and corporate priorities. The focus of RRPCP 
was decided in line with the strategic objectives of the COSOP approved in April 
2018: (i) increase smallholders’ equitable and sustainable returns; and (ii) enhance 
smallholders’ resilience to climate change. The project is also aligned with IFAD’s 
strategic vision and comparative advantage as elaborated in the IFAD Strategic 
Framework 2016-2025, particularly its three strategic objectives: (i) increasing 
poor rural people’s productive capacities; (ii) increasing poor rural people’s benefits 
from market participation; and (iii) strengthening the environmental sustainability 
and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities. 
27.  Potential synergies and partnerships. The project will collaborate with ongoing 
and future interventions by the World Bank, Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), 
FAO, German Agency for International Cooperation, and European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. At the Government’s request, IFAD is negotiating 
the possible provision of cofinancing with the Adaptation Fund (US$9.2 million 
grant) and the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund (RKDF) (US$10 million, on terms 
to be confirmed). IFAD is also discussing joint interventions with IsDB in the Naryn 
Oblast to support fodder production – IsDB through irrigation rehabilitation works 
and IFAD by further promoting the community fodder seed funds initiated under 
the previous portfolio.  
E.  Costs, benefits and financing  
Project costs 
28.  The total investment and incremental recurrent project costs, including physical 
and price contingencies, are estimated at about US$65.206 million 
(KGS 4.6 billion).

29. 
Project financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
IFAD will provide a loan of US$23.03 million (35.3 per cent of the total project 
costs) and a grant of US$8.25 million (12.6 per cent of the total project costs). 
Additional financing of US$9.2 million will be provided by the Adaptation Fund. An 
additional US$10 million in cofinancing is expected from RKDF. The possible IsDB 
parallel financing for about US$20 million would be directed to irrigation 
rehabilitation works benefiting the community fodder seed funds. 
30.  The Government contribution in cash will finance 0.6 per cent of component 2: 
strengthening the food safety system (US$60,000). The Government will also cover 
all taxes and duties, estimated at around US$0.689 million. The contribution by 
beneficiaries is estimated at US$13.97 million. Beneficiaries will be contributing 
both in cash and in kind at various ratios depending on the type of activity. Project 
components (1) (sustainable community-based integrated forest-rangeland 
ecosystem management); (2) (strengthening the food safety system); and 
(3) (climate resilient value chains for women and youth) are partially counted as 
climate finance. As per the Multilateral Development Banks’ Methodologies for 
Tracking Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Finance, the total amount of 
IFAD climate finance for this project is calculated as US$8,822,000, representing 
28 per cent of the total IFAD investment, with US$7,654,000 for adaptation and 
US$1,168,000 for mitigation. If the Adaptation Fund investment fails to 
materialize, it could be offset by redistributing the financing across the board using 
existing IFAD funds. This would reduce the size of the project, but not change it in 
any critical way. 
Disbursement 
31.  The RRPCP will be implemented over five years with an investment to recurrent 
cost ratio of 97:3. The main expenditure categories are civil works, equipment, 
9 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
goods and vehicles, technical assistance, studies, training and workshops and 
grants under investment costs; and salaries and allowances and operating costs 
under recurrent costs. Funds will be channelled to the project through the 
designated accounts opened in United States dollars and Kyrgyzstani som for each 
financing source. Budget and actual expenditure under each financing source will 
be separated in the accounting software, allowing for separate and integrated 
monitoring and planning. The project will use the report-based mechanism for 
disbursement, with withdrawal applications to be prepared by the APIU and the 
Community Development and Investment Agency (ARIS) using the revolving fund 
modality by submitting interim financial reports on a quarterly basis.  
Summary of benefits and economic analysis  
32.  The project is expected to increase: (i) farm-level livestock production and 
productivity; (ii) the quantity and quality of livestock inputs to processing and 
consumption; (iii) product diversification; (iv) sector commercialization, providing 
expanded employment opportunities and higher incomes among the beneficiaries; 
(v) capacities and livelihoods of women and youth; and (vi) greenhouse gas 
mitigation and resilience to climate change.  
33.  Given the benefit and cost streams, the base-case economic rate of return of the 
project is estimated at 24.6 per cent. The base-case economic net present value of 
the project’s net benefit stream, discounted at 10 per cent, is US$27.6 million. This 
shows that the project is economically viable and justified and recommended for 
financing from the economic point of view. 
III.  Risks

35.  The main financial management (FM) risks are as follows: 
Table 5 
Financial management risks 
Indicator  Risk 
Flow of

Internal 
control 
Exposure to exchange rate 
losses from United States 
dollar to local currency; delay 
in receiving government 
contributions in a timely 
manner which would lead to 
risk of IFAD pre-financing of 
Government contributions; 
delay in receiving community 
contributions related to 
matching grant mechanism 
A significant portion of the 
project budget will be spent 
via community grants and by 
smaller implementing 
agencies, the internal control 
environment within these 
structures are generally 
considered weak given large 
geographical spread of 
project. APIU will use various 
smaller implementing 
agencies which may not have 
a sound internal control 
environment.

Mitigation actions 
(i) Accounting software to include cash flow 
forecasting module which is relied on to 
determine the local currency cash need on 
daily basis; (ii) project funds are kept in the 
United States dollar account until needed, 
limiting exposure to exchange rate fluctuations; 
(iii) develop an outlined process within financial 
manual to engage with Government (via APIU) 
when there are delays in receiving Government 
contributions; (iv) early escalation of the issue 
to Government with the aim of reducing delays 
(i) APIU receives monthly reports from 
implementing partners which it reviews, 
monitors and records in the accounting 
software; (ii) ARIS is responsible for 
community-level implementation and has an 
office with financial management structure in 
each Oblast which provides oversight over 
community-level activities; (iii) the financial 
manual to document detailed controls related to 
community grant payments/disbursements and 
detailed controls related to 
payments/disbursements to smaller 
implementing partners; (iv) both APIU and 
ARIS is subject to a review by the Chamber of 
Accounts. 
B.  Environment and social category  
36.  The project is considered to be an environment and social category B operation, as 
it is not expected to have any significant adverse environmental or social 
implications. The project will support the sustainable governance and integrated 
management of forest-rangeland resources in changing climatic conditions. 
Investments in pasture infrastructure and grants to support businesses of rural 
women and youth are on a small scale and will comply with national regulations on 
environment, labour and occupational safety. They are not expected to have 
adverse negative social and environmental impact.  
C.  Climate risk classification  
37.  The project's climate risk classification is considered high. Kyrgyzstan’s 
mountainous landscape is subject to extreme climatic events such as flooding, 
mudslides and drought. The project is intended to rehabilitate highly degraded 
areas such as hillsides and deforested slopes. The project’s main entry point to 
address climate challenges is through the facilitation of integrated planning of 
forest-rangeland areas under the control of PUUs and leskhoses [territorial 
management units]. The project will finance adaptation activities in the form of 
integrated management plans through a competitive grant scheme, and also plans 
to raise additional climate finance from the Adaptation Fund to enlarge the impact 
of the scheme. A climate risk assessment was conducted during the project design.  
D.  Debt sustainability  
38. 
In September 2020, Kyrgyzstan’s external debt reached an all-time high of US$8.7 
billion, then fell slightly to US$8.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021. The increase 
in the nominal value of the external debt is mainly driven by exchange rate 
differences resulting from the devaluation of the som, together with the effects of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, nominal GDP reached US$1.4 billion 
which is less by US$1 billion when compared to the last quarter of 2020 
11 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
(US$2.4 billion in December 2020). By the end of 2021, government debt is 
expected to account for 63 per cent of GDP. 
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Project management and coordination 
39.  The MoA will have overall responsibility for project management on behalf of the 
Government. The project will work under the guidance of a steering committee 
with representatives from the following institutions: MoA (committee chair), SAEPF 
(national designated authority and committee co-chair), MES, SALSGIER and the 
State Agency of Architecture, Construction, Housing and Communal Services. The 
steering committee will include, as observers, representatives of civil society as 
well as of national academia and the research sector.  
40.  The APIU of MoA, and ARIS, which are both currently involved in implementing 
IFAD’s ongoing portfolio, will have the primary responsibility for implementation of 
RRPCP. APIU will have overall responsibility for project oversight and coordination, 
and ARIS will be responsible for all those aspects that involve communities and the 
management of project grants.  
Financial management, procurement and governance  
41.  Financial management. IFAD considers both the APIU and ARIS to have the 
required financial management capability and capacity to implement the RRPCP. 
APIU will manage the largest part of the project budget and will have the main 
responsibility for preparing the consolidated budgets and reports. ARIS and other 
implementing agencies will be responsible for project expenditure related to its 
allocated components and reporting to the APIU. Before implementation starts, 
vacant positions, especially at ARIS main office and the Oblast offices, should be 
filled and configuration of the project in the accounting software should have been 
finalized by both APIU and ARIS. APIU should improve the annual workplan and 
budget (AWP/B) preparation process by ensuring that all agencies provide budget 
inputs as per IFAD requirements. APIU should work on improving project 
monitoring by preparing a consolidated budget to actual expenses comparison on a 
quarterly basis and by addressing any implementation issues in a timely manner.  
42.  Procurement of goods, works and services under the project will be conducted by 
the APIU and ARIS procurement units pursuant to their respective implementation 
responsibility. Both the APIU and ARIS have a good track record with 
implementation of IFAD and World Bank procurement. Procurement will be done in 
line with IFAD’s procurement guidelines.  
43. 
In terms of governance, the project design incorporates various measures to 
assure good governance as indicated by overall operational accountability and 
transparency; financial management; procurement of goods and services; 
environmental governance; gender equality and mechanisms for complaints and 
remedies. 
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communication 
44.  Planning. The period covered by each AWP/B will coincide with the Government’s 
fiscal year, from January to December. The project will develop the AWP/B through 
a participatory approach. ARIS and the other project implementing agencies will 
compile AWP/Bs for components under their responsibility, with due consultation of 
stakeholders, and submit them to the APIU for final agreement and consolidation.  
45.  Monitoring and evaluation. The project’s logical framework and the COSOP 
results framework will form the basis for the overall result-based monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) system and comprise performance monitoring and impact 
12 
EB 2021/LOT/P.13 
assessment. The APIU M&E staff will have lead responsibility for all internal M&E of 
the project.  
46.  Knowledge management and strategic communication. Knowledge 
management will enable the country programme to build a knowledge base of 
actionable data that can be used to better address challenges tackled by the 
RRPCP. It will comprise a communication strategy for relevant stakeholder groups, 
using a project website for communication of basic information about project 
features and updates on implementation, platforms for data management to 
maintain statistics, a repository of knowledge products such as reports and studies 
for analysis and official reporting, as well as brochures, booklets and audiovisual 
communication for awareness-raising and training purposes.  
Innovation and scaling up 
47.  The project will introduce an integrated approach to natural resource management 
whereby land use issues are resolved at the district level by representative organs 
of the key stakeholders, rather than isolated communities. This will include 
institutions currently managing pastures, rangelands and forests. Joint 
consultation, planning and coordination by all relevant stakeholders using a 
common ecosystem approach will result in expedited and lasting governance and 
management results. The proposed nation-wide evidence-based M&E system for 
pastures and forests is also an innovative feature of the project. Moreover, the 
project will initiate a participatory consultative process for rationalizing the 
mandate of three government agencies or departments indirectly responsible for 
food safety certification, and will support a field pilot for cost-effective updating of 
animal identification data for cattle.  
C.  Implementation plans 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
48.  The RRPCP will be implemented by the existing APIU and ARIS. Therefore, the 
fundamental implementation infrastructure is expected to be ready at entry into 
force. The recruitment process of the coordinators, and other specialists required 
for early implementation as foreseen in the procurement plan, should commence 
immediately upon ratification of the financing agreement. 
49. 
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans  
IFAD's supervisory function will be ongoing and support will be provided to resolve 
any issues that may arise during implementation. Supervision missions will take 
place at least once a year and will be organized by IFAD’s subregional hub based in 
Istanbul. A midterm review will be carried out three years after project start-up. 
The project completion review will be undertaken by the Government in close 
coordination with IFAD at the end of the implementation cycle in order to report on 
the results achieved through project interventions. The learning dimension of the 
completion process will be emphasized since it provides useful information for 
improvements in future programme and project designs and programming.  
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
50.  A project financing agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic and IFAD will 
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I. 
51.  The Kyrgyz Republic is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD. 
52. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous, landlocked country of 198,500 km2 bordering Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China. Ninety four per cent of the territory is at an elevation of 
more than 1,000 meters, and 40 per cent above 3,000 meters. Nearly half of the 
country’s total area – some nine million hectares – is pastureland, which plays a key role 
in the country’s economy, society, and culture. The population of Kyrgyzstan is 6.316 
million (2018) of which 65% live in rural areas 
and depend predominantly on agriculture and livestock for their livelihood. With an 
average GDP per capita of US$ 1,293 (2019), Kyrgyzstan is classified as a lower 
middle-income country. 
Kyrgyzstan has declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. While 
transitioning to a democratic society and system of government, the country has proved 
much determined and committed to reducing poverty. This political will was translated 
through multiple reforms including the new pasture law which was adopted in January 
2009 has been a pivotal piece of legislation for the development of the livestock sector. 
This law has decentralized the pastures and rangelands management with the ultimate 
of further valuing livestock sector to generate revenues for local communities. To 
operationalize this reform, the government has collaborated with international donors 
including IFAD in order to raise financing for livestock sector development projects. 
Risk; 
The possibility of social unrest exists with political instability associated with a 
persistent corruption and ethnic divergences. It is likely to lead to a general 
situation of violence, bribery and elite capture. The country’s constitution was 
amended multiple times since independence. 
Mitigations: 
IFAD will work closely with targeted communities to make sure the resources go to the 
intended beneficiaries. For this to happen, policy engagement and non-lending activities 
will be developed and implemented with the purpose of engaging communities at 
grassroots level. The success of project integrative activities of setting up and 
reinforcing capacities of Community Pasture Management and Livestock Development 
Plans (CPMLDPs), which roll out systems for systematically collecting pasture using 
fees to increase Pasture Users Unions (PUU) revenues, is critical to sustaining projects’ 
gains, independently of any political crisis. The approval of the Pasture Law in January 
2009 has started an effective process of reform, putting pastoralists at the centre. 
Kyrgyzstan has since, established many institutions and regulations, substantially 
supported by IFAD projects, to move towards the sustainable governance of pasture 
and forest resources. This project will continue to support PUUs so they become fully 
autonomous and capable of resisting to any external shocks.. 
Governance 
Risk: 
One of the major factors of the livestock sector’s poor performance in Kyrgyzstan is weak 
institutions at the national level responsible for ensuring policy and the regulatory 
framework, producing and transferring required knowledge, and providing technical 
support to livestock producers. In addition, the lack of institutions at the local level to 
mobilize farmers to jointly govern communal resources and protect their rights leads to 
low productivity of the sector, and high incidence of poverty in mountainous livestock 
communities. 
Risk; 
There is a high probability that weak institutions fail to enact the reforms at local level. 
In an environment of poor governance, investments are likely not to produce the 
intended outcomes, as resources will not be used appropriately. There is a high-risk 
level of accountability in the absence of sound governance.

RRPCP will collaborate with local NGOs to fill in the gaps for more social inclusion 
activities. Project activities will promote rural women, youth empowerment, and inclusive 
education as necessary. To further improve governance, IFAD’s anticorruption and 
good governance framework will be applicable to the project. Details thereon are 
included in the Financial Manual. IFAD will deliver a customized training session to 
project staff on this topic during project start-up.

The economy of the Kyrgyz Republic has been ranked among the moderately free for 
the past four years. GDP growth during that time has been solid, thanks to gold exports 
and robust household spending (boosted by remittance inflows from Russia and 
Kazakhstan); robust wage growth; and a slowdown in inflation. Advancements in 
economic freedom are being blocked by ongoing and endemic 
corruption, weak protection of property rights, and excessive government spending which 
crowds out private-sector activity. The economy has remained resilient to an adverse and 
volatile external context, growing at an average robust 3.8% since 
2016, pulled by steady gold exports. 
Risk; 
Downside risks to this outlook include the country’s economic dependence on external 
market led by export of gold and remittances from workers from Russia and 
Kazakhstan. The economy is poorly diversified and positively correlated with export 
market. This means that it collapses anytime when commodity markets takes a 
downturn. The country’s capacity to maintain a satisfactory level of debt service 
depends on externalities. 
More specifically, decreasing remittances from Russia also induced by COVID-19, is a 
risk for the share of the country’s foreign exchange inflows. This will have a direct 
impact on the smallholders’ capacity to accumulate capital for investments and 
smallholders ability to maintain their spending status. 
Mitigations: 
Overall, this risk level is beyond the project’s scope. However, the project can contribute 
to mitigate its effects on targeted populations by diversifying livelihoods through livestock 
value-chain development. By diversifying investment portfolio and building partnerships 
with private sector, the project will create remunerative jobs 
for youth and women. This will ultimately result in reduced migration and more social 
and economic stability with increased smallholders’ capacity to accumulate capital for 
investments and ability to maintain their spending status. 
Additionally, the country’s dependence on remittances from Russia for a large share 
of its foreign exchange inflows will be addressed through partnership with RKDF 
credit facilities provided on affordable terms to project stakeholders. 
Fragility and Security 
Risk: 
Kyrgyzstan models itself as Central Asia’s only parliamentary democracy, but multiple 
challenges threaten its stability. Divided ethnically between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks and 
geographically north and south, the state is deeply corrupt and fails to deliver basic 
services, in particular justice and law enforcement. Its political institutions are under 
stress by the ruling system, and the country is underperforming in terms of democracy. 
Furthermore, there is need to prevent and counter the threat of growing radicalization by 
bolstering the credibility of public institutions and adopting a more tolerant attitude 
toward non-violent Islamists. The rapid rise of alternative religious interpretations, often 
at odds with the state’s concept of traditional identity, are being fuelled in part by 
endemic corruption and perceptions of incompetency.

Risk; 
The risk of violence is high as long as the economic marginalization persists, and weak 
and corrupt institutions remain accountable for delivering basic services. This is further 
aggravated by contracting religious interpretations coupled with the latent ethnic 
tensions, ultimately constituting threats to internal security. 
Another risk factor includes the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The 
pandemic has negatively impacted all sectors, and if it has to continue further, it will 
further aggravate the country’s fragility 
Mitigations: 
The mitigation measures include strengthened policy activities to address root 
causes of social tensions, and institutional capacity building activities. IFAD 
projects will devise non-lending activities aiming at reinforcing local governance and 
accountability. These activities will be closely monitored with projects to ensure 
they contribute to stabilizing and socializing targeted communities. COVID-19 
responses must be prepared. IFAD has already put in place a mechanism of 
response to the pandemic crisis, which entails greater flexibility including 
repurposing of project funds as deemed necessary

The overall framework for development in Kyrgyzstan is guided by the National 
Sustainable Development Strategy 2018-2040 (NSDS). The overall goals of the NSDS 
are the establishment of a state governed by the rule of law, ensuring unity of the nation 
as a prerequisite for preserving statehood, and the resolution of social issues and 
challenges. This is achieved through sustainable economic development and 
macroeconomic stability, improved business environment and 
investment climate, development of strategic industries, and equitable development of 
the regions of the country. The priorities defined by the National Council for Sustainable 
Development with a view to establishing the country’s “Vision for 2040” included 
improving agriculture, providing development opportunities for 
smallholders and creating logistics and processing centres, with emphasis on enhanced 
links between economic access, food security and resilience to shocks in a systemic 
approach to the design of short-, medium- and long-term strategic objectives and results. 
The overall framework for development in Kyrgyzstan is guided by the National 
Sustainable Development Strategy 2018-2040 (NSDS). Specifically for the agricultural 
sector, the NSDS aims at using the geographical and climatological comparative 
advantages of Kyrgyzstan to become a leading supplier of high quality ecological and 
pure, organic agricultural production for the regional markets and the markets of the 
Customs Union. In the agricultural production system there shall be mid- and high 
processing facilities, and development of logistical centers for exports (as per the 
Strategy for Agricultural Development 2017-2022). The strategy 
foresees farmers to participate actively through cooperatives and other mechanisms 
for agglomeration, which will help to add value to produce and thus increase income 
for the local population. 
Risk; 
Political and social stability is key to maintaining the engagement framework. There is 
low risk of Government’s pro-poor strategy to undermine project’s development 
objectives. However, the lack of ownership and fiscal resources from the Government on 
its Strategy for Agricultural Development which aimed at providing support to key value 
chains actors could jeopardize RRPCP’s efforts to increase incomes of smallholder 
farmers through increased milk, meat, crop or forest produce. 
Mitigations: 
The  mitigations measures here  include maintaining and  reinforcing policy  dialogue  in 
order to  maintain the  engagement, and  to  always ensure that  interventions align  with 
national  priorities.  Additionally,  RRPCP  will  seek  to  introduce  integrated  policy 
development, planning and implementation of pasture and forest plans, enabling 
an ecosystem-based approach which, while taking into account connectedness and 
interdependence of pasture and forest resources, will bring social stability. The project 
will increase livelihood resilience, improves smallholder and pastoral productivity, and 
strengthen market participation of stakeholders.

Pasture management reforms in Kyrgyz Republic started as a measure to devolve 
management responsibilities to local governments and communities due to inability 
of government to promote sustainable resource management practices and ensure 
effective management. IFAD supported projects played important roles in this 
major transfer of vast pasture resources from central and provincial/district level 
administration to the level of local governments and further to resource users. At 
the same time, many changes occurred during a period of political instability, which 
weakened the power of local administrators with stakes in the previous system for 
managing pastures. Policy development and implementation in Kyrgyzstan is a 
challenge with weak institutions and unstable political situation. Policy initiatives in 
support of the smallholders in the livestock sector need to be linked to social 
targets, such as increased access to pastures, economic factors such as improved 
animal productivity and profitability (in addition to increased number of livestock), 
and environmental targets, such as improved areas of pasture and increased areas 
under sustainable use. 
Risk; 
The principal risk at this level is the failure of local institutions to channel effectively 
the reforms to livestock communities. Such a failure would result in ineffective 
implementation of investment projects, and ultimately conducive to misuse of 
resources from foreign investments. 
Mitigations: 
Mitigation measures include continued and strengthened donor coordination and 
policy dialogue with government as a whole, and with key ministries; sustained and 
enhanced capacity building, and periodic reassessment of capital investment needs 
by the Government. Furthermore, the project will support the establishment of an 
expert group comprised of various technical expertise with engagement of local 
research and outreach organizations to develop and deliver capacity-development 
interventions to enhance capacity on policy making and rolling out of reforms 
among key stakeholders, and to enforce policy aimed at introducing resource 
saving and low-waste agriculture production technologies, and improved agriculture 
processing techniques.

The Kyrgyz Republic’s climate characteristics are related to its location in the centre 
of the Eurasian continent at a distance from main water bodies and close vicinity to 
deserts. The population of the Kyrgyz Republic is 6,019,000 as of January 2016, 
which is predominately rural and unevenly distributed across the 
country due to its mountainous terrain. Despite progress made in the last few years to 
reduce extreme poverty, climate risks pose significant threats to ensuring sustainable 
livelihoods, food security and infrastructure services. Climate-related events, such as the 
increasing numbers of floods and mudflows each spring, drought in 2008 and severe cold 
spells in 2008-2009, and the cascading impacts on society and the economy, highlight 
the country’s vulnerability to climate risks. Climate change will exacerbate existing 
problems and pose additional risks to the achievement of national sustainable 
development priorities. 
The Project is classified as a Category B operation. This rating results from the few 
identified potentially negative environmental impacts that might be expected from the 
Project’s field activities. The key activities of the project include pastures 
/rangelands management (improvement activities), livestock value-chain 
development, and animal health and food safety. 
Risk; 
If no action is taken, environmental and climate related events would further 
deteriorate the country’s food system and livelihood. The occurrence of climate 
related disasters such as drought, inundation /mudslides is highly likely and 
unpredictable.

Mitigations: 
As a category B project with minimal negative environmental impact, RRPCP will focus 
on raising stakeholders’ awareness of potentially devastating climate effects and ways 
to cope with or reducing them. By so doing, the project will train to use and equip 
targeted groups with technological resources including, GPS, Google- Earth, 
Meteorological data applications. As a result, stakeholders will be able to anticipate 
climate related events and implement appropriate adaptation or mitigation measures 
they will have learned along project activities. For instance, they will be able to relocate 
goods and livestock in such a way to avoid events like floods and mudslides by using 
weather forecasts. Some project training activities will translate into physical 
improvement works on pasturelands and infrastructure (fences, pathways, drinking 
troughs, stalls). Communities will receive training to plan and perform these works in 
ways, which will reduce the likely effect of related climate hazards. For instance, 
delineation, pathways and landscaping activities will be implemented in respect of 
natural slope and drainage. Other mitigations measures include climate-smart 
agriculture practices and the necessary compliance with IFAD environmental, social and 
climate-change safeguard procedures whilst seeking a sustainable management of 
natural resources in the targeted regions. 
The project will review and enhance the existing guidelines for PUU and Leskhozes 
plans considering all issues of environment, biodiversity protection and ecosystem 
functions related to sustainable natural resource management. Areas of focus will 
include different tenure arrangements for use of forest and rangeland resources, such as 
municipal forests, including shelterbelts and windbreaks, as well as private and 
community-based tree plantations, and sustainable fuelwood resources and alternative 
rural fuel sources. 
Project vulnerability to climate change impacts 
Risk: 
The economy of the Kyrgyz Republic faces unique challenges associated with current 
and predicted climate change impacts, due to its geographic and topographic 
characteristics, and the structure of its economy. Changing climate hazards in terms of 
increasing temperatures and uncertainty in future water discharge are bound to affect 
the country’s sustainable development path over the next decades. Population growth 
has resulted in increased pressure on land and water, increased resource consumption. 
The country lacks infrastructure such as irrigation system, has limited productive arable 
land under irrigation, and deteriorating pasturelands. 
Risk; 
There is a high probability that the country falls short of its development objectives 
including poverty alleviation, if the current trend of climate hazards continues. Rising 
temperatures and population growth are likely to result in decreases in precipitation, 
increased rate of evapotranspiration, insufficient water availability for irrigation of crops 
and other agricultural uses, and food shortage. 
Mitigations: 
In order to mitigate these risk factors, the country must develop and adaptation 
measures, and adhere to climate policies. IFAD project plans to involve stakeholders at 
all levels (smallholders, businesses and private stakeholders) in activities addressing 
issues of climate change and effects. The country’s nationally determined contribution 
(NDC) to international climate conventions need to be acted upon. The government of 
Kyrgyzstan collaborates with IFAD and other donors in order to leverage resources to 
be used toward this development objective. IFAD liaises with the ASAP /climate funds 
to make more resources available to the country for addressing climate issues 
adequately. 
Project activities will guide and support communities (PUUs, CLMGs) to overcome 
pasture degradation through adoption of pasture rotation and a change in land use 
practices through training, mentoring and monitoring. The outputs will increase carbon 
sequestration and enable local communities to become more resilient to the adverse 
impacts of climate change. Additionally, IFAD will seek to obtain grants from the 
adaptation funds, which will supplement project resources dedicated to addressing 
effects of climate change.

Project Scope 
Project Relevance 
Risk: 
The RRPCP project is not restricted to any geographical area within the country and 
the Pasture User Unions (PUUs) in the whole country can be further strengthened to 
attain sustainability. The targeted end beneficiaries are the major vulnerable social 
groups in the entire nation, so that the results of Livestock and Market Development 
Program can be further strengthened and that other areas may benefit from the 
experience. Targeting will be based on the existence of a 
village vision or ability to create one, livelihood fragility, actors in the value chains of 
livestock-derived foods and non-timber forest products, and social vulnerability. 
RRPCP is relevant as it seeks to address priorities felt by the country government and 
beneficiaries. Its goal is to contribute to increased incomes and enhanced economic 
growth in pastoralist communities. Although livestock production contributes heavily to 
rural livelihoods, nutrition and food security, and to total agricultural sector output 
growth and exports, productivity is low and far below its potential. The main constrains 
that need to be addressed are inadequate animal feeding due to poor utilization of 
pasture resources, poor animal health, inappropriate farm management practices, and 
weak livestock marketing and processing. 
Risk; 
Risk related to the relevance of this project is low, and concerns a potential deviation 
from the development objective, which about improving livestock communities’ access to 
productive infrastructure and services, enhancing revenues and reducing the severity of 
rural poverty in Kyrgyzstan. 
Mitigations: 
To mitigate the eventuality of such occurrence, IFAD must ensure that implementation 
stays on track to achieving the development objective. This is best addressed through 
regular supervision missions and other follow-up activities. To this end, the project has to 
remain focussed on achieving the strategic objectives of the COSOP approved by IFAD 
EB in April 2018. In the course of implementation, the project will work toward increasing 
smallholders’ equitable and sustainable returns, and enhancing smallholders’ resilience 
to climate change. The project will also remain consistent with IFAD’s strategic vision 
and comparative advantage (as elaborated in IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025), 
particularly increasing poor rural people’s productive capacities and benefits from market 
participation. Additionally, as more resources will become available through GCF 
financing, the project will stay focussed on strengthening the environmental sustainability 
and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities.

IFAD’s current country program consists of the Livestock and market Development 
Project (LMDP2), Access to Market (ATMP), and the soon-to-come Regional Resilient 
Pastoral Communities Development Project (RRPCP). These projects focus on income 
diversification and promote alternative sources of income to diversify household 
economies through improved livestock. The projects explore income-generating options 
beyond livestock production, to add value to livestock products for creating wealth and 
employments. While doing this, the projects seek 
to gradually reduce grazing pressure on pastures and mitigate the impact of climate 
change by establishing Pasture User Unions to manage the common pastures. 
They also provide financing and technical assistance to encourage and nurture new 
economic activities through which the most vulnerable of the rural society – mainly 
women and youth – can build and develop additional sources of income as a safety net 
against possible economic losses. The effective implementation of these projects will 
lead to established socio-economic resilience, enhanced income for youth and women, 
and reduced youth migration. 
Risk; 
Under this section, the risk factor includes the likelihood of elite capture, as the level 
of corruption is substantial in the country.

Mitigations: 
In order to reduce the likelihood of this to happen, IFAD must keep an eye on 
procurement activities, pay attention to the use of funds, and make sure the resources 
effectively go into the achievement of the intended purpose. Capacity- building activities 
focusing on procurement and financial management as well as data management must 
be envisaged. The implementation strategy put in place will ensure that the main project 
benefits go to households in the 454 PUUs areas that constitute the rural population of 
the whole country. A high proportion of the target population will be reached by pasture 
management activities with the largest project investment part going directly to the 
beneficiaries in the form of competitive grants, training and technical assistance. A 
system for awarding competitive grants will be established in the target municipalities, 
and a national monitoring unit will be setup and adequately trained and equipped to track-
record beneficiaries and selection procedures implemented. 
Institutional Capacity for Implementation and Sustainability 
Implementation Arrangements 
Risk: 
There are several institutions that have been engaged in implementing past 
projects as well as in the ongoing LMDP2 and ATMP projects, thus scaling up good 
practices and lessons learned. The two leading institutions among those are Agricultural 
Projects Implementation Unit (APIU) under the Kyrgyz Ministry of Agriculture, Food 
Industry and Melioration (MAFIM), and the Community Development and Investment 
Agency (ARIS), a large organization with outreach in the field. These institutions will have 
the prime implementation responsibility for RRPCP as well. In terms of institutional 
capacity, the government is facing internal challenges in developing the market economy 
and social inclusion. On the other hand, the gaps in these fields have been partly filled by 
national NGOs. 
The MAFIM as IFAD entry point into the country, and primary responsible for the project, 
has delegated the implementation to the Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit 
(APIU) and the Community Development Organization (ARIS). APIU has the overall 
responsibility for coordinating activities and assigning roles to other participating 
institutions, starting with ARIS. ARIS is the key partner of APIU and ensures field 
delivery of activities along with local stakeholders and 
participating community-based organizations. Each participating institution has its 
areas of responsibility and is financially accountable for the implementation of its 
portion or component. Community-based organizations and other participating 
institutions report to ARIS. In its turn, ARIS reports to APIU. A Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOUs) signed between APIU and ARIS clarifies roles and 
responsibilities, and work flow. 
Risk; 
Both APIU and ARIS are government-controlled institutions. They have accumulated 
good amounts of experiences in implementing foreign funded projects. Since the level 
of corruption is substantial in particular in the public sector, one must factor in the 
possibility of distortion of procurement and /or financial management rules. In addition, 
decision-making process being generally lengthy in public sector, there is a high 
probability of project falling behind its calendar in terms of disbursement. Already, the 
negotiations of the Financing Agreement is lingering for months. Furthermore, the use 
of multiple implementing agencies and the coordination of activities among them, are 
additional challenges, which APIU will have to face. The risk of APIU failing to stay up 
to duty is higher in the face of the workload and wide diverse partners. 
Mitigations: 
The mitigation measures include the institutional capacity building. This starts with 
identifying institutional areas of weakness, and addressing them through specific 
training activities as well as exchange visit programs with the purpose of instilling a 
culture of transparency and acquiring good practices. 
With regard to geographical spread, ARIS has a national footprint with a central 
office and regional (Oblast) offices across the country. This gives ARIS a wider 
margin of manoeuvre to handle the widespread of smaller-size implementing field 
agencies. 
In terms of coordination and consolidation challenges, APIU currently manages 
both IFAD and World Bank projects and is experienced in required financial 
management systems and procedures. Financial Management burden is 
centralised at APIU and ARIS Head Offices. APIU is experienced in consolidating 
project information, and R RRPCP will provide financial management training to 
all agencies at project start-up and annually thereafter.

The project’s Logical Framework forms the basis for the overall results-based 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and comprise performance monitoring, 
outcome and impact assessment. The APIU M&E staffs have lead responsibility for 
all internal M&E of the Project. Performance monitoring will concentrate on the 
financial and physical outputs and the outcomes of Project activities and based 
upon semi-annual and annual progress reports. Outcome monitoring will assess the 
use of outputs and measure their benefits at beneficiary level. The monitoring will 
focus on the accessibility of Project outputs and the extent to which they provide 
benefits to the target groups in terms of access to finance, services, and markets. 
Impact indicators have been provided in the Project Logical Framework, and 
comply with IFAD guidelines. 
Risk; 
Risk factors related to M&E include the likelihood of data not being properly or 
timely collected. Data collected may not be representative of outputs and outcomes 
due to miscalculation or tallying issues. Data must also be adequately 
disaggregated. Furthermore, risks at this level may also be about the qualification 
of the project M&E specialist, and their overall use of appropriate tools. However, 
up until now, M&E has not caused any concern, and IFAD rating has been 
consistently satisfactory. 
Mitigations: 
IFAD must make sure that capacity-building trainings are provided to assist project 
M&E staff with, and that the data collection tools in use are in conformity with IFAD 
guidelines. Regular missions will do fact checking to ensure data quality and 
reporting. Regular assessments will be carried out to determine and apply 
corrective measures. 
Moreover, strong review of technical TORs for the recruitment of possible rotational 
M&E staff or punctual expertise will be closely reviewed by the Country Team to 
ensure the highest standard as well as compliance with IFAD’s technical 
expectations. 
Project Financial Management 
Project Organization and Staffing 
Risk: 
APIU: APIU is currently responsible for a large workload of 4 projects (IFAD - 
LMDP1, LMDP 2, ATMP, World Bank - PLMIP) and may not have the ability to take 
on another project. APIU has one disbursement officer managing 4 projects. Not all 
APIU staff have completed the IFAD FM e-learning course. APIU does not 
undertake staff performance evaluations / do not identify areas of improvement 
(and training needs). APIU staff not aware of IFAD’s updated anti-fraud policy 
(approved by Executive Board Dec 2018). The APIU Financial Manager was 
previously a disbursement specialist and promoted to Financial Manager in 
December 2017. She had no Financial Manager experience prior to her 
appointment. APIU will use a number of smaller implementing agencies. The 
competence of these staff has not been assessed at design. 
ARIS; ARIS is currently managing 9 donor funded projects (including 3 for IFAD) 
with a possible concern related to capacity to take on RPLP. ARIS indicated that 
they appoint dedicated staff for new projects, therefore these positions do not 
currently exist for RPLP. Not all ARIS staff have completed the IFAD FM e-learning 
course. ARIS does not undertake staff performance evaluations / do not identify 
areas of improvement (and training needs). 7 ARIS staff resigned in 2018 (only the 
Financial Manager from the finance team) and a prior supervision missions 
highlighted a concern regarding ARIS performance. A new Financial Manager was 
recently appointed.

Mitigations: 
Existing mitigations: 
-Overall, the track record of the APIU/ARIS in managing the financial aspects of 
projects is good and is reflected in the satisfactory FM ratings on existing projects 
(IFAD internal ratings). 
-Both APIU and ARIS is currently well staffed to deal with existing projects. ARIS 
vacancies have been filled). 
-The ARIS Financial Manager is fairly new but engagements with him during the 
design were positive. He seems knowledgeable with regards to FM processes and 
procedures. The disbursement specialists have been with ARIS for a long time and 
are well experienced. 
-LMDP 1 and PLMIP will close before commencement of RPLP, indicating a 
reduced workload for both APIU and ARIS. 
-The APIU Financial Manager has more than 10 years’ of experience within the 
finance department. She is qualified and has attended various IFAD specific 
training related to financial management. 
-The ARIS Financial Manager has many years of experience in similar positions, 
including donor project experience. 
*Additional mitigating recommendations: 
-Require all new APIU and ARIS staff (and existing staff if applicable) to complete 
the IFAD FM e-learning course within 1 month of project start-up. 
-Request the APIU/ARIS to develop a performance evaluation process for FM staff 
within 1 year of project commencement. This process should identify skills gaps 
and assist with identifying appropriate training interventions. 
-Include information on IFAD’s new anticorruption policy in the Financial Manual 
and host a 1-hour session on the topic at project start-up 
-Include an undertaking in the financing agreement with APIU that they should 
ensure that MOUs entered into with smaller implementing partners specify the 
requirement to employ qualified/experienced accountants. 
-Require ARIS to appoint one disbursement officer (based in Bishkek) and 7 
accountants (1 per Oblast) prior to project start-up as a condition precedent in the 
financing agreement. Recruit from the market on a competitive basis and ensure 
that the disbursement specialist has prior donor project experience. TORs outlined

APIU; 
-Requirement to prepare consolidated AWPB which includes activities of all 
implementation agencies (ARIS, APIU and other smaller agencies). 
-For existing projects, consolidated AWPBs are not presented in the correct format 
as required by IFAD. 
-Possible exchange rate fluctuations may result in budgets which are not accurate. 
-For existing projects, the consolidated budget to actual performance is only 
prepared for the purposes of submitting IFRs to IFAD. Therefore, lack of frequent 
monitoring at a consolidated level. 
Mitigations: 
Existing mitigations: 
-APIU is experienced in the IFAD AWPB process and for existing projects, submits 
consolidated AWPBs in a timely manner for IFAD approval. 
-The current exchange rate environment has resulted in more stable exchange rate 
which mitigates the risk of inaccurate budgets due to exchange rate fluctuations. 
-Both ARIS and APIU monitor actual to budget performance for their allocated 
components on a regular basis. 
*Additional mitigating recommendations: 
-Include detailed AWPB template in the Financial Manual. Request APIU to 
disseminate this template to all agencies and ensure that all agencies prepare their 
AWPBs using the same template. 
-Require that quarterly projects meetings be held. For this purposes APIU to 
prepare a consolidated project budget to actual comparison (per category and 
component). This requirement to be outlined in the Financial Manual."

-Risk of IFAD pre-financing of Government contributions. 
-Delay in receiving community contributions related to matching grant mechanism 
(with impact on project disbursements). 
Mitigations: 
Existing mitigations: 
-Existing projects have reasonable disbursement rates and APIU/ARIS is well 
experienced in the IFAD disbursement process. 
-Flow of funds arrangements for existing projects work well and can be replicated 
for RPLP. 
-Proposed 1C Accounting Software has cash flow forecasting module which is 
relied on to determine the local currency cash need daily. Project funds are kept in 
the USD account until needed, limiting exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. 
*Additional mitigating recommendations: 
-Denominated and disburse loans/grants in USD. 
-Develop/outlined process within Financial Manual to engage with Government (via 
APIU) when there are delays in receiving Government contributions. Require early 
escalation of the issue to Government with the aim of reducing delays. 
-Adopt flow of funds arrangement which is similar to existing projects and with 
which ARIS/APIU are familiar (see outlined in Financial Manual).

Internal Audit: 
APIU; 
-The APIU is not included in the MOAM internal audit plan (out of mandate). 
-The APIU will use various smaller implementing agencies which may not have a 
sound internal control environment. 
-The external statutory audit is not expected to test internal controls for the 
purposes of obtaining reasonable assurance. (Baker Tilly confirmed that they do 
not rely on controls and do substantive testing only) 
ARIS; 
-ARIS internal audit department currently has 2 vacancies (Internal Audit Manager 
and IA specialist). 
-The ARIS internal audit programme may not adequately cover community level 
grant activities. (considered high risk area due to lack of financial management 
capabilities). 
-The ARIS Internal audit department is not familiar with IFAD FM specific 
requirements.
