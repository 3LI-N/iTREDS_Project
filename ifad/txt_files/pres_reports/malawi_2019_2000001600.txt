Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in  
paragraph 61. 
I.  Context 
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
1. 
2. 
National context 
The Republic of Malawi is a low-income country, with a per capita GDP of US$338 
in 2017. In that year the agricultural sector contributed about 30 per cent of GDP, 
80 per cent of Malawi's foreign earnings and 77 per cent of total employment. 
Climate-related and political and governance shocks have contributed to economic 
stagnation and a low pace of poverty reduction. Public debt has doubled over the 
last decade, reaching 55 per cent of GDP in 2017. 
The agricultural sector, largely rainfed and dominated by subsistence smallholder 
farmers, supports the livelihoods of the majority of its population, involving 
78 per cent of total households. Crop production accounts for 74 per cent of all 
rural incomes. Productivity is low, exacerbated by a low uptake of improved farm 
inputs/technologies. About 55 per cent of farmers cultivate less than 1 hectare, 
making it difficult for them to produce a surplus for marketing.  
3. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD’s corporate mainstreaming priorities 
In line with IFAD's mainstreaming commitments for the Eleventh Replenishment of 
IFAD's Resources, the programme has been classified as: 
☒ Climate-focused; 
☒ Gender-transformational; 
☒ Nutrition-sensitive; and  
☒ Youth-sensitive. 
4. 
5. 
Environmental degradation and climate change are major development issues that 
have adversely impacted on food security, water quality and energy security.  
The 2017 Gender Inequality Index for Malawi was 0.619, ranking it 148th out of 
160 countries. Youth constitutes 51 per cent of the population, with the youth 
unemployment rate exceeding 40 per cent in 2017. The agriculture sector offers 
many opportunities for job creation for youth, but their participation is constrained 
by challenges that include limited access to finance, land and inputs, limited 
capacity, and perceptions that farming is not a profitable business.  
6.  Malawi ranked 87th out of 119 countries on the 2018 Global Hunger Index and 
suffers from serious levels of hunger and malnutrition. 
7. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
IFAD has contributed to improving the livelihoods of 1.88 million rural poor 
households in Malawi, through investments totalling US$226.9 million. In recent 
years there has been a strategic shift by the Government to commercialization of 
smallholder agriculture, through strengthening access to markets and financial 
services, as well as a focus on adaptation to climate change, as the key drivers for 
poverty reduction. In this regard, IFAD also realigned its support to the 
Government by supporting commodity development through the Rural Livelihoods 
and Economic Enhancement Programme (RLEEP, 2009-2017). RLEEP is the first 
value chain (VC) programme in Malawi to have piloted commercial partnerships, 
under the  
public-private-producer partnerships (4Ps) model.

EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
8. 
The Transforming Agriculture through Diversification and Entrepreneurship 
Programme (TRADE) builds on RLEEP’s results and responds to the 2017-2022 
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy and the Government's priority areas as 
set out in the National Agriculture Policy (NAP) and the National Agriculture 
Investment Plan (NAIP). TRADE also contributes to strategic objective 2 (SO2) and 
SO3 of IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025. 
B.  Lessons learned 
9. 
TRADE builds on lessons from previous IFAD programmes in Malawi, the 2017 
country programme evaluation of the Independent Office of Evaluation and its 
2019 evaluation synthesis on “Inclusive Financial Services for the Rural Poor”.  
10.  The country programme evaluation's recommendations were that future IFAD 
investments should: (i) diagnose the capacity of national and local government 
institutions; (ii) support and build on collective institutions for beneficiaries; 
(iii) enhance the resilience and climate change adaptability of smallholders’ farming 
systems; and (iv) have a marketing development focus. TRADE has incorporated 
these recommendations, with its focus on strengthening farmers’ organizations, 
agribusiness development and supporting smallholder farmers to enhance their 
productivity, while addressing climate change. 
11.  Access to financial services. RLEEP supported the establishment of 637 village 
savings and loan associations (VSLAs), linking formal financial institutions and 
savings and credit cooperatives. VSLAs increased smallholders’ access to finance, 
through direct access to loans or through financial institutions. TRADE will 
strengthen access to finance through VSLAs and financial institutions. 
12.  Farm business schools (FBSs). Under RLEEP, 20,974 lead farmers graduated 
from FBSs. These have been a useful tool for transforming participants’ mindsets 
from subsistence farming to agribusiness. TRADE will thus scale up and strengthen 
the FBS curriculum to equip smallholder producers and non-farmer actors with 
business skills.  
13.  The agricultural commercialization grants allowed RLEEP to reach 37,500 
households, against its target of 24,000. Good results were achieved due to robust 
intervention systems, competitive selection processes and stringent performance 
evaluation of grant recipients. These lessons are reflected in the design of TRADE’s 
Agricultural Commercialization and Innovation Fund (ACIF).  
II.  Programme description 
A.  Programme objectives, geographic area of intervention and 
target groups 
14.  TRADE focuses on promoting climate-smart agriculture and nutrition 
mainstreaming in all programme activities, in line with SO1 of the 2016-2022 
country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP): “smallholder households 
become resilient to natural shocks and enhance food and nutrition security”. It also 
responds to the COSOP’s SO2: “smallholder households access remunerative 
markets and services” by focusing on commercial value chains. 
15.  Programme objectives. TRADE’s overall goal is to contribute to improving the 
sustainable livelihoods of rural people in Malawi. The programme’s development 
objective is increased VC commercialization and the resilience of rural poor and 
smallholder producers. This objective will be achieved by supporting: climate-smart 
interventions; access to commodity markets; access to improved rural financial 
services, market and business development services; and enhanced private sector 
partnerships.  
2 
EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
16.  Geographic areas of intervention. TRADE will initially cover 11 districts1 and 
seven commodities (groundnuts, soybean, sunflower, Irish potato, dairy, beef and 
honey). The aim is to optimize RLEEP’s impact and consolidate and scale up 
successes and good practices in the 11 districts, while bringing in additional 
commodities, which may lead to expansion to new districts. 
17.  Targeting and target groups. TRADE is expected to reach about 300,000 
households (1.32 million people), of which 127,000 households will be direct 
beneficiaries and 173,000 households will benefit indirectly from access to roads 
and employment opportunities. It will target very poor households, women and 
youth. TRADE will focus on rural households, with the potential to improve their 
participation in the commercialization of selected commodities, and to graduate 
from poverty. TRADE will target at least 55 per cent women and 50 per cent youth. 
TRADE’s targeting strategy is focused on nutritionally vulnerable people. 
B.  Components/outcomes and activities 
18.  The programme will have three components:  
(i)  Component 1 – sustainable producer-private partnerships. The 
objective is to support smallholder farmers organized in producer 
organizations/groups to improve their productivity and market linkages, in 
partnerships with small and medium-sized enterprises, in the form of 4Ps or 
similar partnerships.  
(ii)  Component 2 – enabling environment for smallholder 
commercialization. The objective is to improve the enabling environment 
for commercial agriculture, including policies, regulatory framework and 
infrastructure development.  
(iii)  Component 3 – institutional support, programme management and 
coordination. The aim is to strengthen the capacity of smallholder farmers 
to participate in commercial relationships, by developing an ecosystem of 
services, creating inclusive and equitable arrangements.  
C.  Theory of change 
19.  TRADE’s theory of change is based on the hypothesis that by increasing the 
integration and participation of smallholder producers in commercially profitable 
VCs and enhancing their resilience to climate change, combined with improving 
nutrition outcomes, the programme will sustainably improve rural people’s 
livelihoods. This will be achieved through the following outcomes: (i) increased 
sales and revenue for smallholder producers, increased productivity and quality of 
products and adoption of climate-smart agriculture technologies/practices; (ii) a 
conducive environment created for the commercialization of smallholder 
agriculture; and (iii) an enhanced institutional performance and knowledge base for 
VC programming.  
D.  Alignment, ownership, and partnerships 
20.  Alignment. TRADE is aligned with: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 and 
SDG 2, through its overall goal of improving the sustainable rural livelihoods ; SDG 
5 and SDG 8, by promoting gender equality and youth inclusion; SDG 13, by 
strengthening environmental sustainability and the climate resilience of selected 
VCs and infrastructure; and SDG 17, by supporting 4Ps. 
21.  Alignment with IFAD policies is also ensured with regard to mainstreaming gender, 
youth and climate, including through IFAD’s Gender Action Plan 2019-2025 and 
contribution to the IFAD Rural Youth Action Plan 2019-2021.

22.  Country ownership and alignment with national priorities. TRADE will 
contribute to Malawi’s NAP (2016-2020) and NAIP (2018-2023), its Vision 2020 
and the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy 2017-2022. The NAP targets 
profitable commercial farming through specialization of smallholder farm 
production, output diversification and value addition in downstream VCs to which 
TRADE is aligned.  
23.  Partnerships. Partnership opportunities include the World Food Programme’s 
“Food Assistance for Assets” and “Purchase for Progress” and its goat VC 
programmes, which focus on youth and women. Synergies will also be built, in 
component 1, with the African Development Bank-financed Climate Adaptation for 
Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture and the United Nations Development 
Programme’s Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund. 
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
Programme costs 
24.  Total programme costs, including price and physical contingencies, duties and 
taxes are estimated at US$125.4 million for a six-year implementation period. The 
cost breakdown by component is as follows: component 1 – US$60.2 million; 
component 2 – US$53.4 million; and component 3 – US$11.8 million.  
25.  Subcomponents 1.2 and 2.2 are partially counted as climate change adaptation 
finance. The total amount of IFAD climate finance for TRADE is preliminarily 
calculated as US$14.8 million, representing 21 per cent of IFAD programme costs. 
26.  A summary breakdown of programme costs, by component and financier, is

EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
Project financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
27.  TRADE will be financed by: an IFAD loan (US$51.1 million, on highly concessional 
terms); an IFAD grant (US$18.9 million); the Government of Malawi 
(US$15.3 million); an OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) loan of 
US$20.0 million; the private sector (US$11.7 million); and programme 
beneficiaries (US$8.3 million). 
Disbursement 
28.  The programme management unit (PMU) will manage TRADE special accounts (in 
United States dollars) for external financing, and will prepare all disbursement 
requests and justifications. Local currency accounts will be maintained at 
commercial banks and will be subject to Credit Ceiling Authority arrangements. 
Counterpart funding will finance the government portion of expenditure in cash and 
in respect to taxes and duties. 
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
29.  TRADE is expected to reach 1.32 million people. The programme will initially 
support investments in the groundnuts, soybean, sunflower, dairy, red meat, Irish 
potato and honey VCs. The programme may later support the cassava, red 
sorghum and goat VCs, and provide some support to the legume VCs, covered 
under the recently closed RLEEP.  
30.  Programme profitability indicators. TRADE’s overall economic internal rate of 
return (EIRR) is estimated at 18.9 per cent. The economic net present value 
(ENPV) is 62.4 billion Malawian kwacha (US$84.4 million). As the ENPV is positive 
and EIRR is above the social discount rate (SDR), the project is deemed 
economically viable and acceptable for investment. 
31.  Sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of proposed 
interventions. The proxies analysed were: reduction of programme benefits; 
increase in programme costs; and delays in the accrual of programme benefits by 
one and two years. The results show that a reduction of programme benefits of up 
to 20 per cent does not jeopardize TRADE’s economic viability. However, were 
benefits to be reduced by 30 per cent, the EIRR of the project would fall below the 
SDR, and net present value would fall below zero, rendering programme 
interventions no longer worthy of investment. An increase of programme costs of a 
maximum of 30 per cent would not seriously jeopardize TRADE, as its ENPV would 
remain positive and its EIRR would continue well above the SDR. Finally, a delay in 
accrual of programme benefits of two years would not compromise TRADE’s 
economic profitability.  
Exit strategy and sustainability 
32.  Exit strategy mechanisms are largely embedded in the design of each of TRADE's 
(sub)components, as follows:  
(i) 
Sustained outcomes, through establishment of commercial partnerships – 
such as the market-led producer-private partnerships – are likely to continue 
to exist and provide benefits to both private sector and smallholder 
producers. District-level commodity platforms will continue to foster 
relationships between farmers, private businesses and local government. 
Interventions to strengthen resilience to environmental conditions and 
climate change will support viable VCs.  
(ii) 
In terms of policies, advanced trade and export policies and stakeholder 
dialogue – through national VC platforms – will enable a positive impact in 
commercialization. A regulatory framework for supply contracts will enhance 
trust between VC actors and ultimately safeguard programme investments.  
6 
EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
(iii)  Institutional capacity will be built for implementing and monitoring VC 
development activities, which is critical for the continuity of technical support 
to beneficiaries and partnerships upon programme completion. 
III.  Risks 
A.  Programme risks and mitigation measures 
33.  At country level, the following risks have been identified that could potentially 
impact smooth start-up, implementation and achievement of intended development 
objectives and long-term impacts.

TRADE will support capacity-building and will equip districts with resources. It will 
also tap into the available pool of service providers who participated in RLEEP's 
Agricultural Commercialization Fund and those trained by other development 
partners. 
Implementation of the Sustainable Agricultural Production Programme is 
satisfactory; the Financial Access for Rural Markets, Smallholders and Enterprise 
Programme and the Programme for Rural Irrigation Development are moderately 
satisfactory. IFAD supervision improves the performance and participation of 
programmes in in-country policy dialogue. 
TRADE’s financial management arrangements incorporate several measures to 
reduce financial management risks to acceptable levels. In particular, payments 
for interventions implemented by decentralized government staff will be 
centralized at the PMU. A grant manager will be appointed to coordinate and 
manage all TRADE contracts with grant recipients, based on a grant manual. 
Development of standard bidding documents; training of the Ministry of Local 
Government and Rural Development’s procurement officer; ensure that the 
procurement officer and the Ministry’s Internal Procurement Committee are part of 
the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B) process. 
Investment in climate-smart technologies; training to increase smallholder and 
public/private sector capacities to adapt to climate change effects. 
Climate change fact sheets for VCs to provide climate change adaptation options 
that will complement the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). 
Mapping of VC interventions and potential partnerships; transparent management 
of project activities, especially procurement activities and grant administration; 
due diligence for grant recipients. 
B.  Environment and social category 
34.  Environment and social sustainability and climate resilience. Intensification 
and expansion of VCs comes with environmental, social and climate risks. The risks 
have been analysed within the framework of the Social Environment and Climate 
Assessment Procedures (SECAP) review note, and mitigation measures have been 
identified and mainstreamed into design. An Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) has been developed and relevant environmental 
and social impact assessments (ESIAs) will be undertaken during implementation 
for selected infrastructure investments, in compliance with both national and 
SECAP requirements. 
35.  The programme is classified as category A. Potential negative impacts will be  
site-specific, and adequate mitigation measures and opportunities are identified 
7 
EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
within the SECAP review note, the draft ESMP and the ESMF. Particular attention is 
given to promotion of greener technologies, together with good environmental and 
social management practices along all VC segments from pre-production to  
post-harvest solutions. A number of features aimed at addressing social and 
environmental opportunities in each VC are foreseen in subcomponent 1.2. 
C.  Climate risk classification 
36.  The climate risk category is high. Climate projections indicate an increase in 
drought, exacerbating ongoing degradation processes and resulting in increased 
erosion, as well as changes in pasture and feed availability for livestock. Malawi is 
highly exposed and vulnerable to climate change, with the intended programme 
outcomes having a high risk of being negatively affected by climate change. 
Primary risks relate to increasing temperatures and more erratic rainfall, leading to 
changes in pasture and feed availability for livestock. The increasing occurrence of 
extreme events poses an erosion risk to productive lands and public infrastructure, 
with prolonged dry spells adversely affecting productivity.  
37.  A basic climate risk analysis is provided within the SECAP review note to inform the 
programme on best mitigation measures, including measures to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in the dairy and beef VCs. Climate factsheets for each VC will be 
drawn up under the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme. 
D.  Debt sustainability  
38.  Malawi’s external debt is assessed to be at moderate risk of distress, with some 
absorption space. Fiscal discipline should be strengthened to avoid accumulation of 
domestic debt at high interest rates. To enhance resilience, efforts should be made 
to further diversify the economy, broaden the revenue base and strengthen public 
financial management.2 
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Programme management and coordination 
39.  The lead implementing agency for TRADE is the Ministry of Local Government and 
Rural Development, which will work closely with a wide range of stakeholders from 
public institutions and the private sector to commodity platforms, commodity up-
takers and other institutions supporting agribusiness in Malawi.  
40.  Programme oversight will be provided by a programme steering committee 
comprising both public and private sector members, chaired by the Ministry’s 
permanent secretary. The programme steering committee's multisectoral 
composition will ensure harmonization and integration of support in government 
programmes and ensure its contribution to the Government’s strategic priorities 
and sectoral development objectives. 
41. 
Implementation and coordination of the programme will be undertaken by the 
PMU, headed by a national programme coordinator reporting to the Ministry’s 
permanent secretary. The PMU will be granted authority to undertake all financial 
and procurement management activities, lead and supervise programme 
implementation, and provide specialist technical inputs. The PMU staff will be 
recruited competitively under performance-based contracts. Its recruitment and 
contracting will require IFAD approval. The programme will ensure that activities at 
district level are fully owned by the district councils.

EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
Financial management, procurement and governance  
42.  Financial management. The Ministry of Local Government and Rural 
Development has prior experience in the implementation of IFAD-funded 
programmes, including RLEEP. IFAD will provide comprehensive training to the 
finance team in the PMU on IFAD’s financial management requirements and 
disbursement procedures, as well as providing coaching during supervision 
missions.  
43.  Budgeting. The programme will be implemented based on approved AWP/Bs. The 
budgeting process will be undertaken jointly between the PMU, participating 
programme partners and implementing agencies.  
44.  Internal controls. At programme level, internal controls will be established to 
ensure that programme resources are utilized for their intended purposes and are 
reaching the intended beneficiaries. Procedures and record maintenance at all 
levels will be documented in the programme implementation manual and 
consistently applied. The programme implementation manual also includes specific 
provisions regulating set-up of internal controls, effective monitoring and review of 
transactions, accounting software requirements, and all other financial 
management practices, with guidance notes.  
45.  Accounting and reporting. The PMU will be the financial management and 
reporting hub, responsible for posting, reconciling and reporting on programme 
finances. Accounting of TRADE will be done through an off-the-shelf computerized 
accounting software package, to be customized to generate financial reports for 
government and IFAD. The programme will use cash basis of accounting standards. 
46.  Internal audit. As part of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural 
Development, the PMU will be subject to its internal audit procedures. In the event 
that the department is unable to include TRADE in its annual internal audit 
programme, TRADE may contract a private internal audit firm to provide more 
specific support for internal review of controls, proposed improvements and 
issuance of recommendations. 
47.  External audit. TRADE will be audited by the National Audit Office and subject to 
compliance with the audit submission deadlines, so as to avoid potential sanctions, 
including the suspension of disbursements. In accordance with IFAD’s financial 
reporting and audit requirements, TRADE will prepare and submit annual financial 
statements to IFAD, audited by the National Audit Office, together with the 
auditor’s opinion and management letter, no later than six months following 
financial year-end.  
48.  Procurement. Procurement of goods and services to be financed from the loan will 
be subject to Government of Malawi procedures. A procurement specialist will be 
recruited to support the PMU and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural 
Development, and to advise on the conformity of government procedures with 
IFAD procurement guidelines. 
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communications 
49.  Planning. The results-based AWP/B will guide programme implementation, 
including in defining programme activities and outputs (linked to the logical 
framework), defining funding requirements and setting targets. The previous year’s 
performance and challenges will guide development of the AWP/B for the 
subsequent year. The annual planning and implementation cycle will be aligned 
with the Government’s planning cycle. 
50.  The PMU will be responsible for the preparation of AWP/Bs, in collaboration with VC 
specialists, field coordinators and district councils. Planning at district and 
9 
EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
community levels will be through participatory processes engaging farmer-based 
organizations and beneficiaries, thus including disadvantaged groups. 
51.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). TRADE’s M&E system will be guided by the 
theory of change and logical framework. The system will support data collection, 
collation and analysis at different levels, enabling programme managers to identify 
implementation bottlenecks, make informed decisions and take timely corrective 
actions to improve programme performance. An M&E plan will be developed during 
start-up to define concepts, roles and responsibilities. The indicator targets values 
– estimated at design, based on the economic and financial analysis and RLEEP 
results – will be confirmed during the start-up phase, based on baseline survey 
results. M&E functions will be supported by a management information system. An 
information and communications technology-based system will be developed to 
ensure real-time access to information in areas where internet access is unreliable. 
A geographical information system will be integrated. Beneficiaries will be able to 
provide feedback through an SMS (text messaging) platform. 
52.  Reporting. Field coordinators will prepare monthly reports based on the 
information collected. Quarterly reports will be prepared by service providers. 
Reporting on key programme indicators and disaggregation by sex and age will be 
required and clearly set out in the service providers’ contracts. The PMU will 
prepare biannual and annual reports capturing physical progress (outputs and 
outcomes), as well as expenditure against budget. 
Innovation and scaling up 
53.  TRADE’s activities aim at the commercialization of the selected VCs, piloting 
partnership opportunities to evaluate their effectiveness and profitability before 
scaling up. The ACIF will give priority to investments by VC actors that will bring 
innovations to VC development and create sustainable market linkages for 
smallholder producers. Once these innovations prove profitable in specific VCs, 
extension planning areas and districts, they will be replicated in other areas. 
Likewise, the successful VC development and innovations implemented under 
RLEEP will be scaled up by TRADE to other extension planning areas and districts. 
C.  Implementation plans 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
54.  To enhance implementation readiness, implementation in the initial 11 districts in 
year 1 and 2 will be built on the existing VC gap analysis performed upon closure 
of RLEEP.  
55.  SECAP compliance. Due to the scope of roads rehabilitation, the programme has 
been assigned environmental and social category “A”, calling for preparation and 
dissemination of an ESMF, identifying potential risks and mitigation measures and 
specifying selection criteria for the siting of subprojects. The ESMF also provides 
the relevant guidance to the PMU for site-specific ESMPs/ESIAs, in compliance with 
IFAD’s SECAP requirements. 
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans 
56.  The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. 
57.  TRADE shall conduct an end-of-programme evaluation to assess its impact on the 
targeted beneficiaries. This will provide valuable information in preparing the 
programme completion report and lessons for future programming. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
58.  A programme financing agreement between the Republic of Malawi and IFAD will 
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as 
appendix I.  
10 
EB 2019/128/R.25/Rev.1 
59.  The Republic of Malawi is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 
IFAD. 
60. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
VI.  Recommendation 
61. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms 
to the Republic of Malawi in an amount of thirty seven million fifty thousand 
special drawing rights (SDR 37,050,000) and upon such terms and conditions 
as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions 
presented herein. 
RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a Debt Sustainability 
Framework grant to the Republic of Malawi in an amount of thirteen million

Programme Description and Implementation Arrangements 
I. 
Programme Description 
1.   Goal.  The  goal  of  the  Programme  is  is  to  improve  sustainable  livelihoods  of  rural 
people in Malawi. 
2.  Objectives. The development objective is “Increased value chain commercialisation and 
resilience  of  rural  poor  and  smallholder  producers”.  The  development  objective  will  be 
achieved  through  a  holistic  approach  to  addressing  the  agriculture  commercialisation 
challenge.  TRADE  will  seek  to:  (i)  increase  production  and  productivity  by  smallholder 
farmers, (ii) functionally upgrade smallholder farmers and the rural poor to undertake new 
functions  such  as  processing,  storage,  packaging  to  capture  more  value,  (iii)  improving 
horizontal linkages by strengthening the capacities of cooperatives to provide market access 
functions to smallholder farmers, and (iv) improve vertical linkages between stakeholders at 
different functional levels of the commodity chain, including private sector. TRADE will also 
support  rural  entrepreneurs,  focusing  on  youths  and  women  to  develop  and  sustain  their 
agribusiness enterprise opportunities and ensuring that commodities are nutrition sensitive.  
3. 
Components.  TRADE  will  be  implemented  through  three  inter-linked  components: 
(1) Sustainable  producer–private  partnerships;  (2)  Enabling  environment  for  smallholder 
commercialisation (3) Institutional support and Programme management and coordination.  
Component 1: Sustainable Producer-Private Partnerships. The objective of this component 
is  to  support  smallholder  farmers  to  improve  productivity  and  commercialisation,  and  to 
strengthen private sector engagement in the target commodities. The component foresees 
significant  efforts  to  strengthen  smallholder  farmers'  productive  capacity  to  be  able  to 
participate in the commercialization of targeted commodities. Through this component state 
and on-state service providers will be contracted to strengthen producer organizations and 
farmer groups and develop smallholders’ skills to run farming as business. The Agricultural 
Commercialization Innovation Fund (ACIF) will be set up to support viable investments to 
enhance  productivity  and  strengthen  commercial  activities  through  4P  or  similar 
arrangements.  In  this  regard  ACIF  will  finance  business  plans  of  producer  organizations. 
TRADE  support  in  this  component  will  be  through  two  sub-components:  (i) Sustainable 
intensification and commercialization; and (ii) Capacity development of farmers and Farmer 
Based Organizations (FBOs).  
Component  2:  Enabling  Environment  for  Smallholder  Commercialization.  This  component 
seeks  to  improve  commercial  environment  for  TRADE  supported  commodities.  It  is 
comprised  of  two  sub-components:  (i) Enabling  environment  for  commercial  agriculture 
which  will  focus  on  three  activities:  (a)  support  to  commodity  platforms  to  improve  their 
skills  in  negotiation,  policy  lobbying  and  advocacy  (b)  legal  and  regulatory  support  to 
strengthen  commercial  partnerships  between  smallholders  and  private  sector,  and 
(c) market  information  and  market  intelligence;  and  (ii)  construction  and  rehabilitation  of 
basic, need-based public infrastructure essential for promotion of commercial agriculture for 
the TRADE supported commodities.  
Component  3:  Institutional  Support  and  Programme  management.  The  objective  of  this 
component is to strengthen the capacity of smallholder farmers to participate in commercial 
relationships under component 1 by developing an eco-system of services that will create 
inclusive and equitable arrangements. This will be achieved through two sub-components: 
(i) Capacity  building  and  value  chain  governance;  and  (ii)  Programme  management  and 
knowledge management. Activities include: (a) capacity building for public sector and non-
state actors; and (b) programme management and knowledge management.

Target  Population. TRADE is  expected to  reach a total of  about 300,000 households 
4. 
(approximately  1.3  million  people),  of  which  about  127,000  households  will  be  direct 
beneficiaries of TRADE support. About 173,000 households will benefit indirectly from access 
road  construction  and  employment  opportunities  generated  by  commercial  activities  and 
infrastructure construction. The programme will focus on rural households with potential to 
improve their participation in the commercialisation of selected commodities and graduate 
from  poverty.  TRADE  will  target  at  least  55%  women  and  50%  youth  between  18  and 
35 years.  
Programme area. TRADE  will initially cover  eleven (11) districts during the  first and 
5. 
second year of implementation, building on the achievements of RLEEP Project. The aim is 
to optimize RLEEP’s impacts, consolidate and scale up successes and good practices in the 
eleven districts while bringing in additional commodities, which  may lead to  expansion to 
additional districts. The interventions for the seven (7) commodities will be based on the gap 
analysis  conducted  at  completion  of  RLEEP  which  identified  critical  gaps  to  realization  of 
optimum impacts and sustainability of RLEEP investments. The selection of new commodities 
in the third year will be guided by domestic and export market opportunities and potential 
for  commercial  partnerships  between  smallholder  producers  and  private  sector.  The  new 
districts  will  be  selected  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i)  concentration  of  households 
engaged in production of selected commodities; (ii) potential for reaching critical mass of 
ultra-poor  and  transient  poor  smallholders  in  the  respective  commodity;  (iii)  social  and 
demographic  trends,  including  poverty  levels;  (iv)  suitability  of  the  particular  production 
systems  and  local  conditions,  labour  availability,  and  (v)  connectivity  to  market  and 
existence of commercial partners. The scope of expansion will be determined by available 
financial resources, implementation capacity and programme timeframe of six (6) years.  
II. 
Implementation Arrangements 
6.  
Lead Programme Agency. The lead implementing agency for TRADE is MLGRD. 
7.   Programme  Steering  Committee.  The  Programme  oversight  will  be  provided  by  a
