Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to Republic of Zambia for the Enhanced Smallholder Agribusiness
Promotion Programme, as contained in paragraph 55.
Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Zambia for
the Enhanced Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion
Programme
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
Zambia is a landlocked country covering 752,618 km2 with a population of
16 million. Over 70 per cent are aged under 30 and the population grows at
3 per cent per year. While Zambia attained lower-middle-income country status in
2011, inequalities remain very high and poverty reduction has been slow.
2.
During the 2010-2014 period, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of
7 per cent. However, growth fell to 5 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent in 2015,
largely due to lower copper prices and power outages. The Zambian kwacha (ZMW)
has undergone depreciation, from around ZMW 5.5/US$ in 2012 to ZMW 10/US$ in
2016.
3. Widespread and extreme rural poverty and high unemployment remain significant
challenges. Over 50 per cent of Zambians live below the poverty line and
41 per cent in extreme poverty. At 77 per cent, poverty in rural areas is three times
higher than in urban areas.
4.
Agriculture and agroprocessing account for approximately 40 per cent of GDP and
12 per cent of exports, with agricultural production contributing approximately
21 per cent to GDP. Zambia has abundant arable land that is relatively fertile and
experiences good rainfall. The agriculture sector has a dual structure, comprising: a
small number (approximately 740 households) of large commercial farmers and
approximately 50,000 emerging commercial farming households; and
approximately 1.5 million smallholder farming households. There is a large
productivity gap between the commercial and smallholder subsectors. Bridging this
gap and linking farmers to expanding markets has major potential to drive rural
economic growth and poverty reduction.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
5.
6.
RB-COSOP
Connecting smallholder farmers to the flourishing agribusiness sector will allow
IFAD’s target group to share in the rising prosperity enjoyed in urban areas and the
rapidly growing demand for high quality food.
Zambia is plagued with a high level of child malnutrition, with stunting rates at
50 per cent and 46 per cent in rural and urban areas, respectively.1 Further
investment to support smallholder farmers is required to reduce poverty and
increase food and nutrition security. The Government favours the commercialization
of small-scale agriculture as a major driver of rural poverty reduction. Agribusiness
is encouraged to strengthen linkages between smallholder farmers and consumers
through increased private sector participation in service delivery, such as in input

EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
supply, output marketing and agroprocessing. This calls for improved quality,
reliability and scale of production, especially from small and medium agricultural
enterprises. The policy framework promotes self-reliance among farming
households and encourages the development of partnerships among farmers,
government and the private sector.
7.
The ongoing Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion Programme (SAPP) is making
significant progress towards smallholder commercialization and agribusiness
promotion. According to the SAPP 2015 midterm review (MTR), 26 per cent of
sampled households reported increased sales of agricultural commodities averaging
64 per cent per household. Approximately half of households reported increased
selling prices, while 98 per cent reported increased value of sales, and 69 per cent
increases due to value addition. Approximately a quarter of the sampled households
benefited from improved market linkages, while 69 per cent accessed extension
services in business-related issues. Household ownership of assets increased for
55 per cent of those sampled.
8.
The SAPP MTR identified a number of lessons that would improve effectiveness and
inform the design of the proposed Enhanced Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion
Programme (E-SAPP):
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
The need to forge commercial linkages between smallholders and emerging
commercial farmers and higher level value chain actors rather than rely on
the service provider model, which has proven costly and not very effective.
The need to decentralize operations and rationalize institutional arrangements
within existing structures.
The need to improve the skills of smallholder farmers and small and
medium-sized enterprises to identify business opportunities, develop business
plans and negotiate with private sector value chain actors.
The potential of matching grant facilities (MGFs) to leverage significant
investments from the private sector when large enough to attract interest.
9.
Under SAPP, the matching grant uptake was initially slow because: (a) the
development of grant guidelines was a protracted process; (b) the guidelines were
found to be too complex and some potential partners were deterred from
submitting applications; (c) the technical service provider used had no presence
close to the beneficiaries and had to rely on subcontracting; (d) a lack of
involvement of district staff meant there was limited knowledge about the grants at
district level; (e) when SAPP eventually involved district staff, they did not have the
capacity to advise communities in developing fundable proposals; (f) the
beneficiary cash contribution of 10 per cent deterred applications; and (g) potential
applicants for “large” grants found the size of these grants too small to attract their
interest.
10. E-SAPP will focus on building strong and sustainable partnerships aimed at
facilitating the transformation from subsistence farming to farming as a business.
The programme will build on SAPP’s achievements in developing sustainable and
profitable partnerships connecting farmers to commercial opportunities.
II. Programme description
A. Programme area and target group
11. E-SAPP has a multiple commodity focus and nationwide coverage. The selection of
the commodities will define the geographic focus of interventions. The programme
will focus on three commodity groups: (a) legumes (groundnuts, soybeans, beans
and cowpeas); (b) small livestock (poultry, goats, sheep and pigs); and (c) rice.
These were selected on the following basis: (a) over 70 per cent of smallholders
produce these commodities as both food and cash crops; (b) the commodities have
2
EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
significant nutritional benefits; (c) they help fill the seasonal hunger period;
(d) they have high potential for commercialization through partnerships with the
private sector, efficiency gains and value addition; (e) there is a high level of
interest among market intermediaries; and (f) there is potential to deliver quick
results. However, the larger grants under the public-private-producer partnerships
(4Ps) facility will not be restricted to the above value chains or regions.
12. Target group: The Government classifies Zambia’s 1.5 million smallholder farming
households in three categories. Category A (subsistence farmers) will form the
majority of the target group. Category B (economically active) and C (commercially
oriented farmers) will also be targeted to help develop the programme’s
agribusiness linkages, considering that they are already producing a surplus for the
market. The programme will work with approximately 40,000 category A,
16,000 category B and 5,000 category C households.
B. Programme development objective
13. The programme development objective (PDO) of E-SAPP is to increase the volume
and value of agribusiness outputs sold by smallholder producers. The programme
goal is to increase the incomes and food and nutrition security of rural households
involved in market-oriented agriculture. This underlines the central importance of
food and nutrition in efforts to improve the lives of the rural population, but also
the ambition to reach beyond basic needs and increase incomes to enable
households to improve dwellings, send children to school and invest in agriculture.
C. Components/outcomes
14. The PDO will be achieved through three technical components.
15. Component 1: Enabling environment for agribusiness development will help to
establish an enabling policy and institutional environment for commercially oriented
agriculture and rural development. It will advance the capacity-building work
initiated by SAPP and help to address risk management issues. In addition,
subsector policies will be reoriented to integrate climate risk management.
16. Component 2: Sustainable agribusiness partnerships will build the capacity of
smallholders and their service providers to compete for, and implement, matching
grants. This is a key success factor to facilitate the integration of smallholder
farmers within value chains, promote their engagement in the MGF process and
improve their productivity, incomes and nutritional outcomes. This will be achieved
through nutritional education and training on farming as a business, as well as
extending and strengthening SAPP’s MGF experience within a 4P framework. There
will be three MGF windows: linkage of graduating subsistence farmers to markets;
enhancing micro, small and medium-sized agroenterprise (MSME) development;
and facilitating pro-smallholder agribusiness partnerships. They will support
interventions on the supply and demand sides alike to increase output, productivity,
quality and resilience.
17. Component 3: Programme implementation will be conducted through a
programme coordination office (PCO). E-SAPP will finance, in addition to the
planned activities, the PCO costs, office equipment, office consumables, and
vehicles and associated maintenance costs. It will provide PCO staff salaries,
training and technical assistance to address specific needs. The PCO will be
responsible for coordinating and monitoring programme activities, including:
financial management and reporting; procurement; the preparation of annual work
plans and budgets (AWPBs); and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)/knowledge
management. The PCO will conduct annual AWPB review meetings, annual outcome
surveys, biannual implementation reviews and annual knowledge-sharing
workshops. Results and learning-oriented reporting will be based on inputs from
beneficiaries and implementing partners.

EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
III. Programme implementation
Approach
A.
18. Based on lessons learned from SAPP, the entry point for target clients will be the
market intermediaries. The focus will be on a “market pull” approach rather than
“supply push” approach. Market intermediaries include output off-takers, input
marketing, service provision and commodity associations. The 4P clients will be
larger agribusinesses, with the exclusion of commodities such as maize that are
heavily supported by the Government and other development partners. MSMEs will
also be targeted, especially in developing linkages with category B and C
households. The market intermediaries are the primary partners of E-SAPP, with
the smallholders as the beneficiaries. This approach offers opportunities for
sustainable scaling up and replication on the basis of commercial incentives.
19. E-SAPP will adopt a whole value chain approach to improve the economic surplus
by identifying areas where efficiency, productivity and quality can be improved. It
will use government institutions and private-sector partnerships as the entry point
through which to reach smallholder farmers and MSMEs. Implementation will span a
seven-year period, fully embedded in the Government’s decentralized system. The
programme will be harmonized with the IFAD country programme and initiatives of
the Government and other development partners. Potential collaboration is being
explored with the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the United States
Agency for International Development, the European Union, the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations.
Operational framework
B.
20. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) will be the executing agency and delivery systems
will be fully integrated into decentralized government structures. Implementation
arrangements will build on the mechanisms employed by SAPP, enabling a
seamless transition from SAPP to E-SAPP. The MoA Policy and Planning Department
will be responsible for administration and coordination, and supported by a
programme steering committee chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MoA or
his/her nominee.
C.
Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
21. The logical framework will be used as a tool for planning and M&E, to ensure that
necessary information is available for management decision-making, and to
facilitate reporting to the Government, IFAD and stakeholders. Planning will be a
decentralized process, starting at the district level with the preparation of
commodity-specific plans, which will be aggregated into a programme-wide AWPB.
To ensure a truly aligned portfolio, AWPBs for all IFAD programmes will be
harmonized to capitalize on comparative advantages, minimize duplication,
encourage linkages between them and ensure the optimal use of resources.
22. The M&E system will build on the experience of SAPP and provide information that
informs management decision-making and reporting, including data for IFAD’s
Results and Impact Management System. Monitoring will focus on the activities
defined in the AWPB, and on creating a cumulative overview of results/outputs. The
M&E system will be decentralized under the oversight of a planning/M&E officer and
a knowledge management officer. Knowledge management will ensure a continuous
learning process in which data are compiled, analysed and disseminated as lessons
learned, along with thematic studies and stories from the field. Information-sharing
within the aligned portfolio will receive particular attention.

D.
Financial management, procurement and governance
23. Financial management. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions
Index rates inherent risk in Zambia as “medium”, characterized by improved
governance, increasing opportunities for the private sector, and some weaknesses
in public sector management. The fiduciary risk was assessed by IFAD as “high”
mainly due to persistent delays in justification from districts, with consequent
liquidity problems, accounting software not optimally functioning and internal audit
in need of strengthening; improved safeguard measures will therefore be put in
place to reduce risk to “medium”. E-SAPP will employ similar financial management
systems to those used under SAPP, including the accounting software. However,
E-SAPP procurement will be started in advance by another ongoing IFAD project.
Strong training and technical assistance will be provided from the outset. Coverage
of biannual internal programme audits will be included in the audit plan of the MoA
Internal Audit Unit, which will be included in E-SAPP start-up trainings. Internal
audit reports and action plans to implement audit recommendations will be shared
with IFAD as a reporting requirement. Financial reporting will be based on IPSAS2
standards.
24. A designated account denominated in United States dollars will be held at the Bank
of Zambia. Two operating accounts, one denominated in Zambian kwacha and the
other in United States dollars, will be held a commercial bank – the latter is
intended to mitigate foreign exchange risk and will be used for paying foreign
suppliers for contracts denominated in United States dollars and for foreign travel
costs.
25. To address the risk of delayed justification of expenditures by districts: transfers to
districts will be made on the basis of activity-tagged advances that must be retired
before subsequent releases; a system for monitoring advances to districts will be
included in the accounting software; and agents/assistants will be recruited at the
provincial level to follow up and facilitate the justification process and to ensure
expenditure reports and supporting documentation from the districts are collated
and submitted to the PCO on a timely basis.
26. The MGF will be managed by a service provider selected on the basis of relevant
experience, working under the supervision of the PCO. Community mobilization and
training will also be outsourced. The matching grants will be replenished upon each
disbursement to grantees, not once grantees have fully utilized the grants. A
performance-based payment schedule will be included in contracts, and grants will
be regularly monitored. Procedures will be included in the grant manual to
guarantee transparency and minimize the risk of malpractice. After allocation of the
grants under their respective windows, the borrower shall ensure that audits of the
grant allocation process, approval and use of grant funds are carried out by an
independent service provider acceptable to IFAD. Withdrawals from the grants
category may only be made on condition that IFAD has determined that such audits
are satisfactory.
27. Audit. The Office of the Auditor General of Zambia will conduct an external audit of
E-SAPP annually or will have the discretion to appoint an independent private audit
firm acceptable to IFAD. Internal control systems at the PCO level will be
established and MoA will maintain oversight through its Internal Audit Unit.
Supervision missions will review internal audit reports and assess management
responses to recommendations. Internal controls will also be verified during the
annual external audit by the Auditor General, and reported to IFAD in management
letters. The audit reports will be submitted to IFAD no later than six months after
the end of each fiscal year.

EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
28. Procurement. National procurement procedures will be applied to the extent that
they are consistent with IFAD’s guidelines and provided they are assessed as
satisfactory or better. This applies to all procurement except international
competitive bidding for contracts above an agreed threshold. Procurement planning
will follow the templates in the IFAD Procurement Handbook as already adapted for
SAPP and the other IFAD-supported programmes in compliance with the Zambia
Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA). A procurement assessment of SAPP
operations resulted in a medium risk score, largely as a result of staffing challenges
facing the MAL’s Procurement and Supplies Unit (PSU), which tend to cause delays
in the procurement cycle, exacerbated by lengthy processes, including for the
approval of contracts by the Ministry of Justice. Measures to improve procurement
performance will include: the recruitment of a procurement specialist to support the
PSU; capacity-building for the PSU, ZPPA and the Ministry of Justice to address the
procurement delays; and the incorporation of procurement modules into the
financial management software.
E.
29.
Supervision
IFAD and the Government will conduct supervision missions, normally every six
months, to assess achievements and lessons learned and reflect on ways to
improve performance. Implementation support will focus on planning, procurement,
financial management, M&E and the provision of technical assistance. The most
important skills to be provided include: value chain analysis; financial management
and procurement; M&E; poverty and gender analysis and targeting; and
programme management. Key issues likely to require the attention of the missions
will include: M&E, learning and knowledge management; implementation and
reporting delays; procurement; partnerships, beneficiaries and the private sector;
and capacity-building interventions.
IV. Programme costs, financing, and benefits

IFAD will fund the programme through a grant equivalent to approximately
US$1.01 million and a loan on highly concessionary terms in an amount equivalent
to approximately US$21.25 million. Grant-funded activities relate mostly to
capacity-building and facilitating the transition of households from category A to
category B, and eventually to category C. The Government will provide
US$ 2 million in cofinancing, in the form of taxes and duties, and beneficiaries
US$1.23 million, mainly in-kind. The private sector will contribute US$3.46 million
through share of the matching grants; the Indaba Agricultural Policy Research
Institute (IAPRI) approximately US$0.51 million through technical assistance for
policy development; and the Platform for Agricultural Risk Management (PARM)
US$0.2 million for agriculture risk management activities.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
32. The programme will promote the transformation of smallholder farmers from mainly
subsistence level to commercially oriented production by building sustainable and
profitable partnerships with agribusinesses. The economic rationale hinges on
improving smallholders’ integration within value chains through partnerships with
agribusinesses (the 4P approach) that provide improved access to technologies and
inputs, knowledge about improved technologies, better services and enhanced
marketing opportunities. The beneficiaries will be assisted in developing their
entrepreneurial and business capacity through access to technical support and
training.
33. The result will be: (a) increased productivity and product quality; (b) better and
more stable prices through participation in contract farming and/or outgrower
arrangements offering improved market access; (c) expanded farm size and wider
adoption of improved farming practices; (d) sustainable partnerships with the
private sector and enhanced access to services; and (e) added value through
aggregation, sorting, grading, drying and storage.
34. Direct programme beneficiaries. The primary beneficiaries will be approximately
61,000 smallholder households, in particular young people and households headed
by women. This includes 40,000 category A subsistence farmers; 16,000
economically active category B farmers; and 5,000 commercially oriented category
C farmers. Assuming an average household size of five, the total number of
beneficiaries will be approximately 305,000.
35.
Indirect programme beneficiaries. A large number of smallholders will benefit
indirectly through the diffusion of knowledge about improved technologies, and
improved access to marketing services and business information. Consumers will
also benefit from more better quality products and better prices, with positive
effects on nutrition and food security. In addition, all those living in the areas where
8
EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
E-SAPP is active will benefit from strengthened local economies, increased job
opportunities and the development of complementary economic activities
(e.g. input dealers).
D. Sustainability
36. Economic/income sustainability. The value chain/market-led approach will
foster entrepreneurship among smallholder farmers and their integration within
value chains. This will result in the orientation of smallholder groups and individuals
towards market opportunities and a lasting commitment among value chain
partners to enhance value creation. Linkages to markets will ensure that mainly
subsistence farmers have an outlet for their surplus production to assist them make
the transition to farming as a business. As long as the established linkages prove to
be profitable and mutually beneficial, the long-term outcomes will be sustainable.
37. Environmental sustainability will be enhanced through the application of
environmental standards by the MGF recipients, and the implementation of
environmental and social management plans as part of grant-funded activities. This
will be achieved through capacity-building in environmental and social procedures
and risk management. While beneficiaries will acquire tangible benefits from these
standards and plans, those results may not materialize in the short term. The
management team will oversee the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) to reinforce the benefits of integrating environmental
management practices and counteract trade-offs for short-term benefits that may
adversely affect the natural resource base. The ESMF will define the responsibilities
and benchmarks for monitoring environmental impacts and include feedback
mechanisms to incorporate any positive externalities.
38.
Institutional sustainability. To ensure relevance, ownership and sustainability,
E-SAPP will mainstream planning, implementation and M&E into the Government’s
decentralized institutional frameworks and align them with national goals and
policies. Participating institutions will be supported and strengthened to build
institutional capacity (as per subcomponent 1.B) and sustainability. Communities
and grass-roots institutions will be mobilized and strengthened to build their
capacity for sustainability and to take ownership of programme interventions.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
39. The logical framework identifies the main risk areas, and risk monitoring forms part
of the M&E approach. The main risks and mitigation measures are detailed below.
40. There is a possibility that the pipeline of large-scale 4P grantees will not materialize
into grants uptake, due to lack of awareness or the existence of more attractive
grant facilities under other programmes. This risk will be mitigated through:
(a) promoting the existence and terms and conditions of the 4P grants;
(b) identifying potential grantees and inviting them to make applications; and
(c) collaborating with other development partners to ensure that the various
matching grant funds have harmonized terms and conditions. Discussions have
already been held with other development partners concerning this issue.
41. Extension teams at the district level and lower may not be adequately prepared to
identify and support potential MSME grant recipients. Among the lessons learned
from SAPP was that training on business and grant procedures focused on too
narrow a range of government staff. E-SAPP will ensure that marketing, general
and commodity specialist extension staff receive training in farming as a business,
engaging with the private sector and managing/overseeing the MSME grants.
42. The limited capacity of some institutions may delay implementation. To mitigate
this risk, the programme includes capacity-building for institutions facing identified
capacity challenges (subcomponent 1.B).
9
EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
43.
Private sector stakeholders may be reluctant to fully engage in the programme,
resulting in reliance by farmers on government institutions for services that could
be provided by the private sector. To mitigate this risk, the programme provides for
private sector representation on the programme steering committee. In addition,
the MGF service provider will play a catalytic role in private sector participation.
44. A delay in programme start-up would lead to the possibility of implementation
delays and a disbursement lag. To minimize this risk, IFAD and the Government are
taking steps to ensure a seamless transition between SAPP and E-SAPP.
45. A lack of good quality matching grant applications would result in the slow
disbursement of grant resources. The programme will provide training for
applicants, promote the MGF widely and identify potential grantees based on value
chain scoping studies.
46. Climate change and variability will potentially have a negative impact on
productivity, in particular of rainfed agriculture and where farmers have limited
resources to manage risks such as pests and diseases. Measures to reduce impacts
include capacity-building in climate risk management, and vulnerability analysis
that will inform the selection of value chains.
47.
Fiduciary risk, as mitigated by the controls detailed in section III.D above, results in
medium assessment.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
48. E-SAPP will be implemented in compliance with IFAD’s Strategic Framework
2016-2025, as well as IFAD’s policies on natural resource management and climate
change. The programme recognizes the economic and social value of natural assets
through capacity-building for farmers in environmental management, and the
criteria used in the selection of MGF partners. It will support climate-smart
approaches and defines minimum standards for grantees in relation to climate
resilience and capacity-building on environmental, social and climate risk
management. It will also adhere to the principle of livelihood diversification to
reduce vulnerability and build resilience. E-SAPP is also compliant with IFAD’s
Targeting Policy (2006) and Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Policy
(2012). Of the 10,000 market-ready poor households to be targeted, at least
30 per cent will be headed by women and 25 per cent by young people. Moreover,
the nutrition focus is aligned with IFAD’s commitment to nutrition-sensitive
interventions and mainstreaming nutrition.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
49. The programme supports the Government’s policy on reducing poverty through
smallholder commercialization in conjunction with private sector partners. Within
this framework, MoA is expected to focus on its core functions, which include policy
formulation, legislation and regulation. The programme has been developed in
consultation with partners engaged in improving agricultural productivity and
market linkages. Relevant partners will be invited to participate in the screening
and selection of commodities, the mapping of selected value chains, and the
development and implementation of intervention plans.
Innovations and scaling up
C.
50. E-SAPP builds on IFAD experience as a 4P endeavour aiming to reduce rural
poverty by stimulating rural economic development through the transformation of
smallholder producers (including subsistence farmers) into profitable small-scale
commercial farmers. It seeks to improve the effectiveness of policies and practices
to accelerate the growth of farming as a business among Zambia’s 1.5 million
smallholder households. The programme will enhance the focus on women and
10
EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
young people as priority target groups and support the mainstreaming of
nutrition-sensitive agriculture/agribusiness.
D.
51.
Policy engagement
Policy engagement is an integral part of the programme in recognition of the need
for a conducive and inclusive institutional framework for the agribusiness sector
that involves smallholders in policy from design to implementation. The programme
will support the Government in establishing an enabling policy and institutional
environment for commercially driven agriculture and rural development, and help
put structures in place to address agricultural risk management-related issues.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
52. A programme financing agreement between the Republic of Zambia and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as

Programme Description and Implementation Arrangements
I.
Programme Description
1.
Objective. The Programme development objective is to increase the volume and
value of agribusiness outputs sold by smallholder producers. The Programme shall have a
multiple commodity focus and nationwide coverage. The selection of the commodities will
define  the  geographic  focus  of  interventions.  The Programme will  focus  on  three
commodity groups: (a) legumes (groundnuts, soybeans, beans and cowpeas); (b) small
livestock  (poultry,  goats,  sheep  and  pigs);  and  (c)  rice.  These  were  selected  on  the
following basis: (a) over 70 per cent of smallholders produce these commodities as both
food  and  cash  crops;  (b)  the  commodities  have  significant  nutritional  benefits;  (c)  they
help  fill  the  seasonal hunger  period;  (d)  they  have  high  potential  for  commercialization
through  partnerships  with  the  private  sector, efficiency  gains  and  value  addition;
(e) there  is  a  high  level  of  interest  among  market  intermediaries;  and  (f)  there  is
potential  to  deliver  quick  results.  However, the  larger  grants  under  the  public-private-
producer  partnerships  (4P)  facility  will  not  be  restricted  to  the  above  value  chains  or
regions.
2.
Goal. The Programme goal  is  to  increase  the  incomes  and  food  and  nutrition
security  of  rural households  involved  in  market-oriented  agriculture.  This  underlines  the
central  importance  of  food  and  nutrition  in  efforts  to  improve  the  lives  of  the  rural
population,  but  also  the  ambition  to  reach  beyond  basic  needs  and  increase  incomes  to
enable households to improve dwellings, send children to school and invest in agriculture.
Target  group.
3.
The Government  classifies  Zambia’s  1.5  million  smallholder
farming  households  in  three  categories. Category  A  (subsistence  farmers)  will  form  the
majority of  the target  group.  Category  B  (economically  active),  and  Category  C
(commercially  oriented  farmers)  will  also  be  targeted  to  help  develop  the  Programme’s
agribusiness  linkages,  considering  that  they  are  already  producing  a  surplus  for  the
market.  The  Programme will  work  with  approximately  40,000  Category  A,  16,000
Category B and 5,000 Category C households.
4. Components.  The Programme shall consist of the following components:
4.1. Component 1. Enabling environment for agribusiness development. The Component
will  help to  establish  an  enabling  policy  and  institutional  environment  for
commercially  oriented  agriculture  and  rural  development.  It  will  advance  the
capacity-building  work  initiated  by  SAPP  and  help  to  address  risk  management
issues. In  addition,  subsector  policies  will  be  reoriented  to  integrate  climate  risk
management.
4.2. Component 2. Sustainable agribusiness partnerships.  This Component will build the
capacity of smallholders and their service providers to  compete for, and implement,
matching  grants.  This  is  a  key  success  factor  to  facilitate  the  integration  of
smallholder  farmers  within  value  chains,  promote  their  engagement  in  the  MGF
process  and  improve  their  productivity,  incomes  and  nutritional  outcomes.  This  will
be achieved through nutritional education and training on farming as a business, as
well as extending and strengthening SAPP’s MGF experience within a 4P framework.
There  will  be  three  MGF  windows:  linkage  of  graduating  subsistence  farmers  to
markets; enhancing micro, small and medium agro enterprise (MSME) development;
and 
facilitating  pro-smallholder  agribusiness  partnerships.  They  will  support
interventions on the supply and demand sides alike to increase output, productivity,
quality and resilience.

EB 2016/119/R.22/Rev.1
4.3. Component 3.
Programme  implementation.
The  Component  will  be  conducted
through a  Programme  Coordination  Office  (PCO).  The  Programme  will  finance  the
PCO costs,  office  equipment,  office consumables,  and  vehicles  and  associated
maintenance  costs.  It  will  provide  PCO  staff  salaries,  training  and technical
assistance  to  address  specific  needs.  The  PCO  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating
and  monitoring  Programme activities, 
financial  management  and
reporting; procurement; the preparation of annual work plans and budgets (AWPBs);
and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)/knowledge management. The PCO will conduct
annual  AWPB  review  meetings,  annual  outcome  surveys,  biannual  implementation
reviews  and  annual knowledge-sharing  workshops. Results  and  learning-oriented
reporting will be based on inputs from beneficiaries and implementing partners.

Implementation Arrangements
Lead  Programme  Agency.
5.
The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (MoA)  will  be  the
executing  agency  and  delivery  systems  will  be  fully  integrated  into  decentralized
government  structures. Implementation  arrangements  will  build  on  the  mechanisms
employed by SAPP, enabling a seamless transition from SAPP to E-SAPP. The MoA Policy
and  Planning  Department  will  be  responsible  for  administration  and  coordination,  and
supported  by  a programme  steering  committee chaired  by  the  Permanent  Secretary  of
MoA or his/her nominee.
6.
PCO. The PCO will be charged with the overall responsibility of coordinating and
monitoring implementation of Programme activities, including: (a) financial management
and  reporting;  (b)  coordination  of  all  procurements 
for  goods  and  services;
(c) preparation  and  coordination  of  Annual  Work  Plans  and  Budgets  (AWPBs);  and
(d) monitoring  and  evaluation  of  Programme  activities  and  undertaking  knowledge
management.  The  PCO will  conduct  annual  AWPB  review  meetings,  annual  outcome
surveys,  biannual  implementation  progress  reviews  and  annual  national  stakeholders’
knowledge  sharing  workshops. Results  and  learning-oriented  progress  reporting  will  be
based  on  inputs  from  beneficiaries  and implementing  partners  using  appropriate
technologies.  Monitoring  results  will  be  part  of  the  six  monthly  progress  reports  and
assessment/evaluations of the Programme will be an essential element of all reviews.
7.
Matching Grant Facility.  The Matching Grant Facility (MGF) will be managed by a
service  provider  selected  on  the  basis  of  relevant  experience,  working  under  the
supervision of the PCO. Community mobilization and training will also be outsourced. The
matching  grants  will  be  replenished  after  each  disbursement  to  grantees,  not  once
grantees  have  fully  utilized  the  grants.  A  performance-based  payment  schedule  will  be
included in contracts, and grants will be regularly monitored. Procedures will be included
in  the  grant  manual  to  guarantee  transparency  and  minimize  the  risk  of  malpractice.
After  allocation  of  the  grants  under  their  respective  windows,  the  Borrower/Recipient
shall ensure that audits of the grant allocation process, approval and use of grant funds
are carried out by an independent service provider acceptable to IFAD. Withdrawals from
the grants category may only be made on condition that IFAD has determined that such
audits are satisfactory.
8.
Planning. The Logical Framework will be used as a tool for planning and M&E, to
ensure that necessary information is  available for management decision-making, and to
facilitate  reporting  to  the  Government,  IFAD  and  stakeholders.  Planning  will  be  a
decentralized  process,  starting  at 
the  preparation  of
commodity-specific  plans,  which  will  be  aggregated  into  a  Programme-wide  AWPB.  To
ensure  a  truly  aligned  portfolio,  AWPBs  for  all  IFAD  programmes  will  be  harmonized  to
capitalize on comparative advantages, minimize duplication, encourage linkages between
them and ensure the optimal use of resources.

and  provide  information  that  informs  management  decision-making  and  reporting,
including data for IFAD’s Results and Impact Management System (RIMS). Monitoring will
focus  on  the  activities  defined  in  the  AWPB,  and  on  creating  a  cumulative  overview  of
results/outputs.  The  M&E  system  will  be  decentralized  under  the  oversight  of  a
planning/M&E officer and a knowledge management officer. Knowledge management will
ensure  a  continuous  learning  process  in  which  data  are  compiled,  analysed  and
disseminated as lessons learned, along with thematic studies and stories from the field.
Information-sharing within the aligned portfolio will receive particular attention.
Financial  management. 
  The  Programme  shall  employ  similar 
10.
financial
management  systems  to  those  used  under  SAPP,  including  the  accounting  software.
Strong  training  and  technical  assistance  will  be  provided  to  ensure  that  the  Programme
will  be  in  full  compliance with  the  government’s  and  the  Fund’s  financial  requirements.
Coverage of biannual internal programme audits will be included in the audit plan of the
MoA Internal Audit Department.  All internal audit reports and action plans to implement
audit recommendations will be shared with IFAD.
To  address  the  risk  of  delayed  justification  of  expenditures  by  districts:  transfers  to
districts  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  activity-tagged  advances  that  must  be  retired
before  subsequent  releases;  a  system  for  monitoring advances  to  districts  will  be
included  in  the  accounting  software;  and  agents/assistants  will  be  recruited  at  the
provincial  level  to  follow  up  and  facilitate  the  justification  process  and  to  ensure
expenditure  reports  and  supporting  documentation  from  the  districts  are  collated  and
submitted to the PCO on a timely basis.
Audit. The Office of the Auditor General of Zambia will conduct an external audit
11.
of the Programme annually or will have the discretion to appoint an independent private
audit  firm  acceptable  to  IFAD.  Internal  control  systems  at  the  PCO  level  will  be
established  and  MoA  will  maintain  oversight  through  its  Internal  Audit  Department.
Supervision  missions  will  review  internal  audit  reports  and  assess  management
responses to recommendations.
implementation. 
12.
Supervision.    IFAD  and  the  Government  will  conduct  supervision  missions,
normally every  six  months,  to  assess  achievements  and  lessons  learned  and  reflect  on
ways to improve performance. There will also be a Mid-Term Review after three years of
Programme
focus  on  planning,
procurement, financial management, M&E and the provision of technical assistance. The
most important skills to be provided include: value chain analysis; financial management
and  procurement; M&E;  poverty  and  gender  analysis  and  targeting;  and  project
management. Key issues likely to require the attention of the missions will include: M&E,
learning  and  knowledge  management; 
reporting  delays;
procurement;  partnerships,  beneficiaries  and  the  private  sector;  and  capacity-building
interventions.
