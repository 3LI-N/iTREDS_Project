Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of the Philippines for the Convergence on Value Chain
Enhancement for Rural Growth and Empowerment Project (CONVERGE), as
contained in paragraph 37.
Proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the
Convergence on Value Chain Enhancement for Rural
Growth and Empowerment Project (CONVERGE)
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
In 2009 the population was 92.2 million and growing at 2.04 per cent annually. In
2010, gross national income per capita was US$4,002 (in 2008 dollars). Since 1981
GDP growth has averaged 3.1 per cent per annum, but only 2.3 per cent per
annum from 2001 to 2010. Over the period 2004-2010, the headline inflation rate
averaged 5.6 per cent. The Human Development Index of 0.638 in 2010 ranked
the country 97th among 169 countries, whereas in 1998 it was 0.744, which shows
that, over those 12 years, development efforts were unable to improve the human
development status. The gender development index decreased from 0.768 in 2005
to 0.742 in 2008 and the gender empowerment measure fell from 0.590 in 2005 to
0.560 in 2008. The national poverty incidence decreased slightly, from
21.1 per cent of families in 2006 to 20.9 in 2009. But with population growth, the
number of poor families rose from 3.67 million to 3.86 million in the same period,
higher than in 2003. Farmers and fishers were the poorest groups in the country,
with a poverty incidence of 44 and 50 per cent, respectively, in 2006. Nationally,
income inequality remains high, with a Gini coefficient of 0.448.
2.
The failure to reduce poverty in recent years reflects underinvestment and the slow
growth of per capita incomes, high population growth and dependency rates,
natural disasters and inflationary pressures, mainly from rising fuel and food
prices. Despite the recent lack of progress in reducing the incidence of poverty, the
Philippines Development Plan (PDP) 2011-2016 envisages that the country can still
achieve Millennium Development Goal poverty reduction targets by 2015.
Favourable factors exist that may help the country break out of its perennial
condition of widespread rural poverty, inequity and lagging human development,
including a healthy external payments situation, years of trade reform (leaving an
industrial sector fairly undistorted by subsidies and heavy protection), a stable
currency, low inflation and positive political developments.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and RB-
3.
COSOP
The proposed project is consistent with the PDP 2011-2016, the IFAD Strategic
Framework 2011-2015 and the IFAD country strategy for the Philippines for 2010-
2014. The rationale for IFAD’s help in financing the project is to: (i) exploit
opportunities to support the agrarian reform process and help meet the needs of
under- and unserved agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) – through a value chain
approach to enhance agricultural growth and agribusiness development – in order
to maximize benefits from the land distribution programme; (ii) support
harmonization of rural development efforts by the Departments of Agrarian Reform
(DAR), Agriculture (DA) and Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and
other agencies engaged in agribusiness development, in order to maximize impact
in rural poverty reduction; and (iii) support the DAR approach of clustering
agrarian reform communities to realize economies of scale for production, access to
1
EB 2015/115/R.13
markets and service provision in order to benefit from value chain development.
The project will contribute to the PDP’s goal of a competitive and sustainable
agriculture and fisheries sector through improved food security and increased rural
incomes, and it supports the national Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Programme.
4.
The project is part of the National Convergence Initiative (NCI), which seeks to
synchronize the initiatives of the three departments engaged in rural development
– DAR, DA and DENR – and optimize use of the resources available to support
sustainable rural development. Linkages will be built with the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) under the Rural Microenterprise Promotion Programme, with
the DA under the Second Cordillera Highland Agricultural Resource Management
Project and with the DENR under the Integrated Natural Resources and
Environmental Management Project approved by the Executive Board in December
2012. Lessons learned in ongoing and previous projects have been incorporated
into the design.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
5.
The project will target Regions IX, X and Caraga, located in the west, north and
north-east of Mindanao, which are the three poorest regions of the country,
accounting for 18 per cent of those living below the national poverty line. Within
the three regions, the project will target 11 agrarian reform community (ARC)
clusters, including 93 ARCs in 48 municipalities in 10 provinces. The target group
includes ARBs, other smallholders, under- or unemployed rural youth, indigenous
peoples (IPs), women, and business development partners, including eligible
people’s organizations (POs). The total size of the target group is estimated at
144,732 agricultural households (about 773,106 people), including non-ARC
barangays (villages) and IP households. Of this total, ARBs account for 59,217
households, of which 30 per cent are headed by women. The major crops
cultivated include coconut, rice, maize, rubber, banana, high-value vegetables, oil
palm, coffee and cassava. Some 29 per cent of ARC average incomes are below the
poverty line.
B. Project development objective
6.
The overall goal of the project is to contribute to the reduction of poverty incidence
in the 10 target provinces of Regions IX, X and Caraga. The project’s development
objective is to enable ARBs and other smallholder farmers in the 10 target
provinces of Regions IX, X and Caraga to become highly productive and
competitive entrepreneurs and contribute to the achievement of broad-based rural
economic growth. The expected impact and outcome indicators for the
approximately 35,000 households and 100 POs (e.g. farmers’ cooperatives and
associations) in the 11 ARC clusters include: (i) average annual income increased;
(ii) increased farm income derived from new farming activities; (iii) increased
ownership of household assets; and (iv) reduced prevalence of child malnutrition.
C. Components/outcomes
7.
The project has the following components: (1) participatory value chain analysis
and planning; (2) integrated smallholder agricultural and rural enterprise
development; (3) subdivision of collective certificates of land ownership award and
facilitation of land transfer programme; and (4) project management, monitoring
and evaluation and knowledge management.
8.
Component 1: Participatory value chain analysis and planning. The expected
outcome of this component will be that value-chain business development plans for
selected crops are validated and implemented, resulting in improved farm income.
In each of the 11 ARC clusters, the component will support: (i) validation of the
proposals for value chain development as identified by the feasibility studies;
(ii) identification of the gaps and inefficiencies in the value chains and of the
solutions and investments required; (iii) identification of POs and private-sector
2
EB 2015/115/R.13
organizations wishing to and capable of participating in value chain development;
and (iv) updated ARC value chain investment plans (ARC-VIPs).
9.
Component 2: Integrated smallholder agricultural and rural enterprise
development. The expected outcome of this component is improved production,
value addition and marketing of selected agricultural commodities. The component
has two subcomponents: (i) farm and value chain enterprise development; and
(ii) investment in value chain-related rural infrastructure.
10. Under farm and value chain enterprise development, the project will support
improvement of the quantity and quality of production at the farm level and the
phasing of production to meet market demand. It will achieve this through farmer
training, capacity-building and the provision of technical and farm management
advice in product testing, soil analysis, production technologies and management,
adaptation to threats from climate change, environmental awareness-raising and
good agricultural practices. This will involve the private sector (e.g. extension
personnel employed by buyers or consolidators) and/or public-sector agencies (e.g.
DAR development facilitators, technical staff of local government units (LGUs) and
the Agricultural Training Institute). In the area of value addition and diversification,
the project will facilitate the creation of appropriate business models and of the
institutional structures required to enable smallholders and their organizations to
engage in value addition and enterprise development, with private-sector
management of these value chains. The project aims to increase farmer share in
value chains through product differentiation and the already-mentioned value
addition and diversification. Project interventions will be implemented through the
provision of matching grants when there is a clear opportunity to improve
profitability for the target group. Other investments to enhance value addition
include the provision of assistance for product development, branding, packaging,
logistics, certification/accreditation, technology and equipment upgrading, and
organizational development through training with a focus on meeting market
requirements. The project will provide investments, on a cost-sharing basis, to
match the contributions of private-sector participants for eligible proposals and for
financing the equipment associated with post-harvest facilities.
In the area of market and investment facilitation, the project will develop linkages
within the value chain among input providers, producers and buyers to enhance
the profitability of farm enterprises. Assistance in consolidating supplies to meet
the volume and frequency requirements of buyers and investors is part of this
process. The assistance provided will include support for improving and/or
extending existing market information systems, trade fairs, business and investors’
forums, and assistance in negotiations with buyers and investors for leasehold,
contract growing, joint venture or marketing arrangements. The project will make
use of the expertise of agencies such as DA, DENR, DTI and the Department of
Science and Technology (DOST) to enable target beneficiaries to optimize
production of their chosen commodities, improve their market access and
competiveness, generate greater profits and provide a more integrated package of
services in the priority chains to be developed. The project will also assist project
beneficiaries in accessing funding from the banking and microfinance sectors using
a combination of approaches: private-sector enterprises involved in the value
chain; project matching grant funds to farmers, POs and private-sector
organizations meeting strict eligibility criteria for investments; development of the
capacity of viable farmers’ organizations to access finance from the formal banking
sector, government finance institutions and microfinance institutions; and linkages
with financial institutions to develop appropriate financing packages and products
for the value chain initiatives.
11.

EB 2015/115/R.13
12. Under investment in value chain-related rural infrastructure, after participatory
planning with target ARCs and target group members, the project will invest in
rural infrastructure subprojects meeting eligibility and priorities criteria to support
value chain development. Eligible infrastructure includes farm-to-market roads,
rehabilitation/restoration of communal irrigation schemes (CISs), water-harvesting
and management, post-harvest facilities (storage, auction centres, etc.) and water
supply required to process local produce for value chain development. Irrigators’
associations and farmers’ groups/associations will operate and maintain CISs and
post-harvest facilities, while LGUs will maintain the farm-to-market roads.
Investments in additional road construction will take place only after firm funding
has been secured from participating LGUs. In addition, the capacity of LGUs to fund
and undertake maintenance of the roads will be closely monitored.
13. Component 3: Subdivision of collective certificates of landownership
award (CLOA) and facilitation of land transfer program. This component will
cover the subdivision of CLOAs and facilitation of land transfer action to stabilize
ownership and property rights in the project areas. This will provide incentive to
farmers to make their lands more productive and enable them to access credit and
engage in agribusiness projects with private investors. Target outputs and
outcomes for this component will be under the regular programme of DAR and will
be funded under the regular budget of DAR.
14. Component 4: Project management, monitoring and evaluation and
knowledge management. The expected outcome of this component is that the
project is completed on time, within the agreed budget, and to the satisfaction of
beneficiaries. The output will be timely, cost-effective and transparent
management that is gender and culturally sensitive. The component will finance
the costs of project management and coordination, monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) and reporting activities at national, regional and provincial levels. It will also
finance the costs of contracted project staff based in the central project
management office (CPMO) in Mindanao, the three regional project management
offices (RPMOs) and in the 11 provincial project management offices (PPMOs),
honorariums of DAR regular staff assigned to the project, equipment, vehicles,
short-term consultants, training, preparation of project manuals, case studies and
operating costs.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
15. The key elements of the overall project approach are: (i) use of a participatory
value chain development approach to enable target beneficiaries to optimize
production of their chosen commodities, sustainably improve the profitability of
household farm enterprises, improve their market access and competiveness and
generate greater profits; (ii) application of convergence in implementing project
activities under the leadership of DAR to enhance the investment and opportunity
climate for agribusiness; (iii) use of the ARC clustering approach for the provision
of support to ARCs for value chain development; (iv) implementation through DAR,
at all levels, with the participation of the other agencies (e.g. DTI, DOST, LGUs and
the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples [NCIP]); and (v) emphasis on
knowledge management (KM) and learning to ensure that experience and lessons
learned are available to improve project performance and for scaling up and wider
dissemination.
16. The project implementation period is six years. The implementation strategy will
include: (i) geographic targeting to identify the project areas and provide a
preliminary list of target commodities based on the 11 feasibility studies and
investment plans already prepared; (ii) selection of private sector organizations to
provide marketing and/or other services that meet the proposed eligibility criteria
during the initial participatory value chain analysis and planning phase; (iii) self-
targeting by members of the target group based on their interest in participating in
4
EB 2015/115/R.13
project activities; (iv) non-poor households will be targeted through their inclusion
in the POs or other types of organizations formed; and (v) provision of public
goods, such as improved farm to market roads, rehabilitated CISs, post-harvest
facilities, etc. Consultations were held with the NCIP, the organization charged with
supporting the integration of IPs in the mainstream. The approach to working with
IPs as a sub-group of the target group will work within the framework of the NCIP’s
Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development and Protection Plan. This approach
involves putting into practice the principle of free and prior informed
consultation/consent on all project activities by providing adequate information.
B. Organizational framework
17. DAR will be the lead agency for project implementation, in cooperation with DA,
DENR, DTI and DOST. DAR has the necessary institutional capacity and structure to
undertake this role and the experience gained from implementing over 60
externally funded projects – including two recently completed IFAD projects that
were implemented satisfactorily in Mindanao. DAR has staff at all levels of
government, down to the municipal level (municipal agrarian reform officers), and
a development facilitator assigned to each of the 11 ARCs to work with
beneficiaries. The project management structure involves a CPMO based in
Cagayan de Oro (Region X); RPMOs in each of the three regions; and PPMOs in
each of the 10 provinces (two operational divisions in Bukidnon). The oversight
structure includes a project steering committee at the national level as the
project’s policymaking body; a regional multi-stakeholders committee (RMSC) in
each of the three regions to advise regional project implementers on major policy
considerations and technical and operational issues and to ensure participation of
the region-based agencies in project implementation; and a cluster project
operations team (CPOT) in each of the 11 ARC clusters to serve as coordinating
mechanisms for delivery of government services to the clusters.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
18. At start-up, project staff and stakeholders at national and regional levels will
prepare a multi-year global workplan and budget for achieving project objectives
and targets, for approval by the project steering committee. Participatory planning
of annual workplans and budgets (AWP/Bs) will start at the barangay and ARC
cluster levels, involving representatives of the ARCs, CPOTs and PPMOs. The
project will have a results-based M&E system to report the status of project
implementation and progress on outputs, outcomes and impact. The overall M&E
system will consist of regular reports and process monitoring by the CPMO, based
on data provided by RPMOs, PPMOs and implementing agencies, and
communicating the project’s physical progress data and financial accounts,
maintained by the CPMO and regional/provincial offices. During the first project
year (PY1), DAR will undertake a baseline survey to cover all indicators of the
logical framework, including RIMS indicators, and, subsequently, midterm impact
and completion impact surveys. M&E and KM units will be established in all
implementation levels. M&E documentation results will contribute to policy studies
to improve the business environment for smallholder farmers in the Philippines,
with a view to scaling up within the country.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
19.
Financial management of the project will follow government systems, rules and
regulations for receipts and disbursements of proceeds from the loan – to the
extent that they are consistent with IFAD’s standard disbursement procedures. The
Bureau of the Treasury, through DAR, will maintain one designated account
exclusively for the loan. DAR, through the CPMO, will be responsible for overall
management of project funds, which includes: oversight of project operations,
procurement, internal control, accounting, review and consolidation of project
AWP/Bs, physical and financial reporting, audits; and consolidation of accounts and
5
EB 2015/115/R.13
withdrawal applications. RPMOs and PPMOs will be accountable for project funds
received for implementation of the project. DAR will execute a memorandum of
agreement with each of the partner implementing agencies at national, regional,
provincial and municipal levels to specify the services and support to be provided
by each agency and by the project.
20.
IFAD’s review of the project implementation manual (PIM) will be a precondition of
disbursement. Guidelines in the PIM will be consistent with the Government’s and
IFAD policies, systems and procedures. Annual financial statements on project
funds will be prepared in accordance with acceptable accounting standards, such as
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), or national standards where these are
converging towards internationally recognized best practice and/or are deemed to
provide minimum disclosures.
21. The project’s consolidated financial statements will be audited annually in
accordance with IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits. All project accounts will be
audited, including all sources of funding. Annual audit reports will be submitted to
IFAD within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
22. The project will follow government procurement regulations (RA 9184) using the
latest implementing rules and regulations – to the extent that they are consistent
with IFAD’s Project Procurement Guidelines. IFAD will apply a zero-tolerance policy
to fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions.
E. Supervision
23. Annually, IFAD and the National Economic Development Authority will jointly
conduct a full supervision and implementation support mission, and a post-
supervision mission 6 to 9 months later, depending on progress.
IV. Project costs, financing, benefits
A. Project costs
24.
Project costs are estimated at about US$52.53 million over a six-year
implementation period, including taxes and duties estimated at US$5.96 million or
11 per cent of total costs. Price contingencies of 3 per cent, and physical
contingencies have been computed at 3.5 per cent of base costs on all items, both
decided by the National Economic and Development Authority.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
26.
It is estimated that about 35,000 rural households will benefit directly from the
project, including 3,000 jobs to be generated by the project in the value added
subsector. Some 15,000 households, not counted elsewhere, will benefit from
improved rural roads, bringing the total to 50,000 beneficiary households. The
main incremental outputs following project investment in the target ARC clusters
will derive from the priority products selected by the feasibility studies. Likely
benefits at the farm level will stem from increased production and improved
productivity, enhanced value added at the farm level and higher prices as a result
of both quality improvements and more efficient marketing. Additional benefits will
be generated by the project’s capacity-building programme, e.g. strengthened
capacity to participate in value chain and rural enterprise development, and for
implementing agencies, capacity to target and manage poverty reduction and rural
development programmes in a gender-sensitive and participatory manner.
27. The financial and economic impact of the project has been assessed by:
(i) preparing detailed feasibility studies for the value chain investments that are
likely to be undertaken under the project; and (ii) analysing each model to
ascertain probable impact at the individual farmer level, in comparison with typical
without-project incomes. The project shows an economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) of 44.6 per cent and a cost-benefit ratio of 1.57 discounting benefits and
costs at 15 per cent. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are
robust. For example, the project would still be viable if all costs increased by
20 per cent and benefits 20 per cent lower. The economic and farm budget
analyses will be updated based on market demand and value chain analysis
undertaken in the first year.
D. Sustainability
28. The following elements are built into project design to help ensure that the
proposed investments and benefits are sustainable: (i) dedication of the first year
of implementation to the analysis, identification and planning of the project’s
investments in priority value chains involving famers, their organizations and the
7
EB 2015/115/R.13
private sector; (ii) the experience and lessons learned in the implementation of the
11 feasibility studies contribute to ensuring that subsequent investments are
sustainable; (iii) the project has a strong focus on involvement of the private sector
on a long-term basis to enhance the sustainability of investments and benefits;
(iv) it will support contractual and other types of arrangements linking smallholders
with the private sector to enable them to move up the supply chain and incorporate
greater value addition; (v) beneficiaries and LGUs will be involved in providing
counterpart funds for infrastructure facilities and will be responsible for their
operation and maintenance; (vi) project design takes into account the knowledge,
systems and practices of IPs, which will also help ensure the sustainability of
project interventions in areas where IPs are present; and (vii) 18 months before
the completion date, the CPMO will work closely with all stakeholders at national,
regional, provincial and municipal levels, and with ARCs and barangays, to finalize
an exit strategy and sustainability plan based on specific mechanisms to ensure
sustainability after the end of the project.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
29. The first risk is that effective coordination among the three NCI agencies in the
field will be more difficult than at the national level. Project design counters this
risk as follows: (i) all agencies having a role in project implementation will be
members of the project steering committee to be able to resolve inter-agency
coordination issues; (ii) all implementing agencies will have an NCI focal point
through whom the project will interact with the NCI at the national level; (iii) the
three RMSCs will include representation of all relevant agencies to ensure effective
coordination of implementation in the regions and ARC clusters; and (iv) within
ARC clusters, CPOTs will include staff involved in day-to-day project
implementation. The second risk is the degree of willingness of the private sector
to be involved in implementation of component 2, which is essential for the success
of the project. This risk is addressed through: (i) component 1 and the
participatory analysis and planning process, which will involve all potential
participants, including representatives of private-sector agencies involved in the
particular value chains under analysis; and (ii) during the value chain analysis and
planning process, publication of the availability of grants for value chain
development to match investments from the private sector, the size of the grants
available, and the terms and conditions of the grants for diverse interventions. The
third risk is the weak capacity of poorer LGUs to provide the required counterpart
funds for rural infrastructure investment. The project counters this risk by reaching
an agreement with the Government on a financing plan for these investments
based on a financing ratio of 80 per cent for the IFAD loan, 5 per cent for national
government counterpart funds, 12 per cent on average for LGUs and 3 per cent for
beneficiary contributions.
V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policies
A.
IFAD policies relevant to the project include: the IFAD Targeting Policy: Reaching
30.
the Rural Poor; Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment; Engagement with
Indigenous Peoples; IFAD Rural Enterprise Policy; IFAD’s Private-Sector
Development and Partnership Strategy; IFAD Climate Change Strategy; IFAD Rural
Finance Policy; and IFAD Policy on Preventing Fraud and Corruption in its Activities
and Operations. Project design has reflected these policies and lessons learned in
the IFAD country programme. The project is classified as Category B and employs
the following mitigation measures: value chain development is resilient to climate
change, environmentally friendly and sustainable; training includes management
and adaptation to the threats of climate change and environmental awareness;
environmentally friendly and sustainable production systems will be promoted (e.g.
use of the farming systems approach, good agricultural practices and varieties that
can tolerate climate variability); and DENR and its local offices will be involved to
ensure that value chain development is in line with good practices for
8
EB 2015/115/R.13
environmental and natural resource management.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
31. The project objective is aligned with the PDP’s goal of a competitive and
sustainable agriculture and fisheries sector. The project will complement other
donors working in the same sector – such as the Asian Development Bank, Japan
International Cooperation Agency and World Bank – to increase project impact in
poverty reduction and on policy dialogue with the government and other
stakeholders. IFAD will also work with government programmes for an improved
policy environment and governance. The project will explore diverse types of
partnership arrangements between project beneficiaries and the private sector,
ensuring that such arrangements are fair to farmers and ARC communities.
Private-sector organizations and business development partners can take a leading
role as innovators in improving the returns from existing and emerging value
chains in an enterprise-oriented development approach.
Innovations and scaling up
C.
32. The project will be the first foreign-assisted project under DAR to support the NCI.
Its investment is quite small when compared with the growth needed to make a
serious dent in rural poverty in Mindanao. However, the project could catalyse
improved household incomes and attract further investment for scaling up – in
order to fully realize the potential benefits of Mindanao’s comparative advantage in
key agricultural commodities.
Policy engagement
D.
33. The project will finance policy/case studies – for policy dialogue and consultation
with relevant national and local institutions and with other stakeholders – on
planning and implementation of the value chain approach to agro-enterprise
development, mechanisms for convergence and other relevant studies. The studies
envisaged could include: (i) consolidation of smallholder production to achieve
economies of scale in production and marketing, appropriate business models, and
contractual and legal arrangements; and (ii) innovative engagement of the private
sector in providing rural infrastructure to support value chain development.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
34. A financing agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as an
appendix.
35. The Republic of the Philippines is empowered under its laws to receive financing
from IFAD.
36.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
37.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the
Republic of the Philippines in an amount equivalent to twenty-two million
eight hundred thousand euros (EUR 22,800,000), equivalent to approximately

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements
I.
Project Description
Target Beneficiaries. The Project will directly benefit 300,512 farmer
1.
beneficiaries composed of 38,724 agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) and
261,788 other rural workers in eleven agrarian reform communities (ARC) Clusters
in ten (10) provinces in Region IX (Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur and
Zamboanga Sibugay), Region X (Misamis Oriental, Camiguin and Bukidnon) and
CARAGA (Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Sur and Surigao del Norte)
(Project Area). The other rural workers are composed of smallholders, un- or
underemployed rural youth, indigenous peoples (IPs), women, and business
development partners, including eligible people’s organizations (POs – e.g. farmers’
cooperatives and associations) involved in the value chains selected and willing and
able to participate in Project interventions. The target are among the six poorest
regions of the country. Within the three regions, the Project will target 91 ARCs and
50 municipalities in ten (10) provinces with a possible extension to qualified ARC
clusters within the Bangsamoro region.
Goal. The Project aims to contribute to the reduction of poverty incidence ten
2.
(10) provinces of Regions IX, X and CARAGA through the promotion of sustainable
livelihood activities based on key commodities e.g. rice, rubber, coffee, cassava and
coco sugar that are deemed competitive in the Project Area. The agriculture and
fishery sector through participatory value-chain development will improve and
sustain the profitability of smallholder farmers.
Objectives. Specifically, the Project intends to enable ARBs and other small
3.
farmers in ten (10) provinces of Regions IX, X and CARAGA to become highly
productive and competitive entrepreneurs and contribute to the achievement of
broa-based rural economic growth by: (i) increasing the quantity and improve the
quality of commodity production; (ii) improving the phasing of production in
conjunction to meet market demand; (iii) adding value to farm produced by
improving post-harvest handling/management; (iv) strengthening/developing
farmers’ linkage to selected value chains; and (v) diversifying sources of income
through development of alternative livelihood/agri-enterprise activities in
partnership with the private sector.
Components. The Project shall consist of the following four components: (i)
4.
Participatory Value-Chain Analysis and Planning to Link Smallholder Farmers to
Existing Value-Chain Systems; (ii) Integrated Smallholders Agricultural and Rural
Enterprise Development; (iii) Subdivision of Collective Certificates of Landownership
Award (CLOA) and Facilitation of Land Transfer Program and (iv) Project
Management, Monitoring and Evaluation and Knowledge Management.
4.1 Component A: Participatory Value-Chain Analysis and Planning to Link
Smallholder Farmers to Existing Value-Chain Systems
The expected outcome of this component will be that value chain business
development plans for selected crops validated and implemented resulting in
improved farm income. This component will provide in each of the 11 ARC clusters:
(i) validation of priority commodities and market analysis of the potential of the
major commodities for future value chain development; (ii) prioritization of the
commodities, processing and rural-based enterprises for Project support and
identification of the “anchor value chain” and the “secondary” enterprises; (iii)
identification of the gaps and inefficiencies in the value-chains and solutions and

investments required; (iv) identification of POs (associations, cooperatives) and
private sector organizations wishing to participate and capable of participating in
the value-chain development; and (v) updated ARC Value-chain Investment Plans
(ARC-VIPs).
Commodity value-chain investment plans for the eleven ARC clusters were
implemented in 2014/15 by DAR. Activities under this component include value-
chain investment planning for secondary crops, as well as capacity building to
ensure that small-scale producers/processors can adapt to market changes.
4.2 Component B: Integrated Smallholders Agricultural and Rural Enterprise
Development
This component is developed based on the results of component A. It aims to
improve production, value addition and marketing of the selected agricultural
commodities.  The subcomponent on farm production will specifically focus on the
improvement of quantity and quality of production at the farm level, and the
phasing of production to meet market demands. The Project will finance the initial
costs of inputs (seeds, seedlings, and fertilizers), tools and equipment, capacity
building for the farmers and the provision of technical and farm management.
Subcomponent on value addition and diversification, on the other hand aims to
upgrade strategies to enhance enterprise development including: product
development, branding, packaging, logistics, certification,/accreditation, technology
upgrading and training on post-harvest handling and storage, food safety and
product quality. The Project will also undertake market and investment facilitation
to develop linkages within the value chain particularly among producers and buyers
and input providers to enhance the profitability of the farm enterprises. This
includes support for improving the existing market information systems, conduct of
trade fairs, business and investor’s for a and assistance in negotiations with buyers
and investors for leasehold, contract growing, joint venture or marketing
arrangements.
The Project will also provide financing assistance and raise the necessary capital
investment through: (i) the private sector enterprises involved in the value-chain;
(ii) matching grant funds to farmers, POs and private sector organizations; (iii)
assisting eligible farmers and POs to access grant funds from other sources; (iv)
developing capacity of viable farmers’ organizations, so they can access finance
from the formal banking sector/government’s financing institutions and micro-
finance institutions (MFIs); and (v) the financial institutions to develop appropriate
financing packages and products.
Importantly, the Project ConVERGE will invest on value-chain related rural
infrastructure. This component includes provision of farm-to-market roads, bridges
and drainage crossings, rehabilitation/restoration of communal irrigation systems
(CIS), post-harvest facilities, and water supply required for the processing of local
produce.
4.3 Component C: Subdivision of CLOA and Facilitation of Land Transfer Program
This component will cover the subdivision of CLOAs and facilitation of land transfer
action to stabilize ownership and property rights in the project areas.  This will
provide incentive to farmers to make their lands more productive and enable them
to access credit and engage in agribusiness projects with private investors. Target
outputs and outcomes for this component will be under the regular programme of
DAR and will be funded under the regular budget of DAR.

4.4 Component D: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation and
Knowledge Management
The expected outcome of this component is that the Project is completed on time
and within the agreed budget. This component will finance the costs of Project
management and coordination, compilation, reporting and Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) activities at national, regional and provincial levels. In addition,
the Project will finance policy studies, stakeholders' consultations and other events
related to the planning and implementation of the value-chain approach to agro-
enterprise development, mechanisms for convergence, and any other relevant
policy studies.
II.
Implementation Arrangements
A.
Approach
5.
The Project will use a convergence approach in implementing its activities
under the leadership of DAR. The National Convergence Initiative combines the
efforts of three national government agencies involved in the agriculture, agrarian
reform and natural resource sector, namely Department of Agriculture (DA), DAR
and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) with the aim of
providing more comprehensive and integrated support to smallholders and others in
the rural areas. The Project implementation will extend the concept of convergence
with DA and DENR as co-implementing agencies of DAR and to involve other
agencies with a potential role to play in Project implementation, including
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Science and Technology
(DOST), National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and Mindanao
Development Authority (MinDA) as well as the Department of Interior and Local
Government (DILG)-LGUs.
The Project implementation involves essentially two phases. In the first year,
6.
the Project will use the value chain studies prepared by the DAR. Activities in the
crops validated by the beneficiaries will start in those communities expressing
interest in them. In tandem with the Project stakeholders, the Project will identify
an appropriate package of activities to intensify production, improve productivity,
and to determine the need for access to markets, roads, irrigation and other
marketing infrastructure to support these crops. Once experience has been gained
with activities pertaining to the selected crops, the Project will consider adding
selectively other crops/farming activities of interest to the beneficiaries as
expressed in the cluster development plans. Prior to doing so, the Project will
conduct a simple market demand analysis and if found that there is ample demand,
this will be followed (if necessary) by a simplified value chain analysis to consider
providing support to other immediate points along the selected chains for which the
Project will provide investment funds. The aim of this phase is to validate and
review the preliminary analysis of potential priority commodities prepared during
the Project design and identify the champion and secondary value chains in each of
the 11 target ARC clusters in ten provinces for which the Project will provide
investment funds. The next five years will be the main investment phase of the
Project in developing the selected value-chains with Project support, winding down
during the last year of the Project (PY6).
The key elements of the overall Project approach are the following: (i)
7.
implementation through the DAR structure at national, regional, provincial and
municipal levels, with the participation of the other convergence agencies using
existing government staff to the maximum extent possible; (ii) use of the ARC
clustering approach developed by DAR for the provision of support to the ARCs for
value chain development; and (iii) an emphasis on knowledge management and
learning to ensure that the experience and lessons learned are available to improve

Project performance and for wider dissemination.
The implementation strategy will include: (i) geographic targeting to identify
8.
the Project areas and provide a preliminary list of target commodities for further
assessment at the start of the Project for value chain development; (ii) selection of
private sector organizations to provide marketing and/or other services that meet
the proposed eligibility criteria (Annex 5) during the initial participatory value chain
analysis and planning phase; (iii) self-targeting by members of the target group
based on their interest in participating in Project activities; (iv) non-poor
households will be targeted through their inclusion in the POs or other types of
organizations formed; and (v) provision of public goods, such as improved farm to
market roads, rehabilitated CIS, post-harvest facilities, etc.
Consultations were held with the NCIP, the organization in charged with
9.
supporting the integration of IPs in the mainstream. The approach to working with
IPs as a sub-group of the target group will work within the framework of the NCIP’s
Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development and Protection Plan, as a way of
involving the community
members with the local government agencies and a vehicle to strengthen capacities
of  IPs  in  the  process.  This  approach  involves  practicing  the  principle  of  free  and
prior informed consultation/consent on all Project activities through the provision of
adequate information.
B.
Organizational framework
10. DAR will be the Lead Project Agency, which will also involve DA, DENR, DTI,
DOST, MinDA and DILG-LGUs. In case there will be changes in the organisation of
agencies providing support to farmers/ARBs, DAR will be the Lead Project Agency
to continue the implementation of this Project. DAR has the necessary institutional
capacity and structure to undertake this role and the experience gained from
implementing over 60 externally funded Projects, including two completed IFAD
Projects that were implemented satisfactorily in Mindanao. DAR has staff at all
levels of government, down to the municipal level (municipal agrarian reform
officers), and a development facilitator assigned to each of the 11 ARCs to work
with beneficiaries. The Project management structure involves a Central Project
Management Office (CPMO) based in Cagayan de Oro in Region X; Regional Project
Management Offices (RPMOs) in each of the three regions; and Provincial Project
Management Offices (PPMOs) in each of the 10 provinces (two operational divisions
in Bukidnon).
11. The PSC chaired by the Secretary of DAR shall be the policy making body for
the Project. Other members shall be senior officials of the DA, DENR, DTI, DOST,
DOF, DBM, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), DILG, MinDA
and private sector representative. The PSC shall review and approve the Project’s
Annual Work Plan and Budgets (AWPBs), Annual Procurement Plans and PIM, upon
the recommendation of the CPMO.
12. A CPMO located in Mindanao shall act as the PSC Secretariat, with the Project
Director as the Committee’s secretary.  It will provide overall direction, and directly
supervise project implementation in Regions IX, X and CARAGA.
13. The Multi-Stakeholder’s Committee (RMSC) shall be located in Regions IX X
and CARAGA. The DAR Regional Director (RD)shall chair the RMSC with senior staff
representative from the DA, DENR, NEDA, DTI, DOST, NCIP, DPWH, DILG,
beneficiaries representative as members. Other attached agencies, such as NIA,
FIDA, and PCA, shall be invited as needed. The LGUs shall serve as resource
persons when the RMSC reviews sub-project proposals prior to approval.

14. The RPMO shall be established in the three (3) regions covered by the Project,
under the leadership of the DAR’s RD. It shall supervise and provide technical
support to project implementation in the ARC clusters.
15. A Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) shall be located in every
target province under the leadership of the DAR Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer
II (PARO II). It shall implement project activities in the ARC cluster and prepare the
ARC cluster AWPBs and procurement plans, monitor progress and report which shall
be submitted to the RPMO.
16. A Cluster Project Operations Team (CPOT) will be convened in each ARC
cluster. The CPO shall be responsible for the implementation of Project activities in
the respective ARC cluster. A DAR Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer will head the
CPOT with member from the DAR’s development facilitators, LGUs (e.g., Municipal
Agriculture Officer, Municipal Engineer, Municipal Planning and Development
Officer, Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Officer), NCIP Service
Center’s Officer, DENR’s Community Environment and Natural Resources Officer,
private sector organizations and other implementing agencies as necessary.
C.
Planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and 
management
learning  and  knowledge
17. At start-up, the Project staff and stakeholders (representatives of
beneficiaries, the private sector, etc.) at national and regional levels will prepare a
multi-year global workplan and budget for achieving Project objectives and targets
for approval by the Project steering committee. Participatory planning of AWPBs will
start at the barangay and ARC cluster levels, involving representatives of the ARCs,
CPOTs and PPMOs. The Project will have a results-based M&E system to report the
status of Project implementation and progress on outputs, outcomes and impact.
The overall M&E system will consist of regular reports and process monitoring by
the CPMO, based on data provided by RPMOs, PPMOs and implementing agencies
and based on the Project’s physical progress data and financial accounts,
maintained by the CPMO and regional/provincial offices. During the first Project
year (PY1), DAR will undertake a baseline survey to cover all indicators of the
logical framework, including RIMS indicators, and, subsequently, midterm impact
and completion impact surveys. Monitoring and evaluation and knowledge
management units will be established in the CPMO and in each of the RPMOs and
PPMOs. The outputs of these units will include documentation of innovative
approaches and good practices in participatory value-chain analysis and planning
methodology for sharing and replication. Based on these findings, policy studies will
be prepared to contribute to improvement of the business environment for
smallholder farmers in the Philippines, with a view to scaling up within the country.
D.
Financial management, procurement and governance
Financial management of the Project will follow the government systems,
18.
rules and regulations for receipts and disbursements of proceeds from the Loan to
the extent that they are consistent with IFAD’s standard disbursement procedures.
The Bureau of Treasury, through DAR, will maintain one Designated Account for the
loan. DAR, through the CPMO, will be responsible for overall management of Project
funds, which includes: oversight of Project operations, finance and procurement,
implementation support for Project implementers; review and consolidation of
Project AWPBs; physical and financial reports and audits; and consolidation of
accounts and withdrawal applications. RPMOs and PPMOs will be accountable for
Project funds received for implementation of the Project. DAR will execute a
memorandum of agreement with each of the partner implementing agencies at
national, regional, provincial and municipal levels to specify the services and
support to be provided by each agency and by the Project. Annual financial

statements on Project funds will be prepared in accordance with acceptable
government accounting standards as long as these converge towards internationally
recognized best practices and/or are deemed to provide minimum disclosures. The
Project audit will follow the rules and regulations of the Commission on Audit and
IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits. The Project will follow government procurement
regulations (RA 9184) using the latest implementing rules and regulations – to the
extent that they are consistent with IFAD’s Procurement. IFAD will apply a zero-
tolerance policy in respect of fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions.
Where an investigation performed by IFAD, the Borrower or another competent
entity has determined that fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions have
occurred in Projects financed through its loans and grants, IFAD will enforce
sanctions in accordance with the provisions of applicable IFAD rules and regulations
and this Agreement.
E.
Supervision
Project supervision during the first 12-18 months will focus on ensuring that
19.
there are no delays in Project start-up and address any bottlenecks that may occur.
Supervision will focus specifically: (i) the various aspects of overall Project
management
to ensure that the AWPB is prepared and approved and that the PY1 AWPB is
operational; (ii) the PIM, which will be prepared by the CPMO following the design
completion mission and before Project start-up is in use; (iii) assessment of the
Project institutional arrangements and Project management and coordination
related issues; (iv) assessment of the results of the validation of the priority crops
of interest to the POs and review of the need for market demand and value chain
analysis for additional crops; (v) assessment of the implementation of the pilot
value chains to gain lessons, as a failure to undertake these activities in a timely
fashion will delay Project implementation and/or lose the benefits learned from the
initial stages of the pilots; (vi) review of terms of reference of the Project value-
chain staff and consultants and making and agreeing changes, if necessary; (vii)
re-examining the need for subsidies and review options for cost recovery through
the use of guarantees for bank loans to participating enterprises and the ability of
famers to obtain production credit; (viii) the Project financial management,
accounting and internal controls processes are are satisfactory at central, regional,
provincial levels and within the ARC clusters; (vi) the bank accounts have been
opened and the initial deposit received from IFAD; (ix) a functioning M&E/KM
system has been set up; (x) the initial procurement of goods and services,
especially that of the Project management staff and value-chain consultants, is
completed in a timely fashion; and (xi) the training relating to various aspects of
Project management, e.g. financial management, procurement, physical and
financial reporting, etc. is being implemented. By concentrating on these subjects,
the delays that often affect the start-up of IFAD Projects can be avoided or
addressed before they lead to significant delays.
20. Annually, IFAD and the NEDA will conduct a full supervision and
implementation support mission jointly with the government and a post-supervision
mission 6-9 months later depending on progress. Expertise required will include: (i)
a value-chain specialist familiar with Mindanao and value-chains that have
provisionally been identified during Project design; (ii) a rural infrastructure
specialist; (iii) a financial management specialist familiar with both IFAD and
government procedures responsible for financial management, loan disbursements
and procurement; and (iv) a community development specialist from time to time.
Staff members from IFAD, the DAR SSO-FAP and NEDA will also be on the missions.
