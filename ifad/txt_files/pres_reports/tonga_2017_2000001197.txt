Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Tonga Rural Innovation Project – Phase
II, as contained in paragraph 50.
Proposed loan and grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the
Tonga Rural Innovation Project – Phase II (TRIP II)
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
The Kingdom of Tonga is a small Pacific Island country with a population of 103,036.
It covers a land area of 718 km2 comprising 170 islands spread over 700 km2 of
ocean. Both the severity and depth of poverty have increased significantly in the last
decade. The outer islands have experienced the sharpest increase in hardship. About
half of Tonga’s poor live in the rural areas of Tongatapu, the main island.
2. Some 85 per cent of the population resides in rural areas, with agriculture and
fisheries being the main livelihood activities. Rural communities rely on traditional
subsistence production systems of root crops for food security, employment and
income generation. Despite underlying resilience, there are a number of factors
seriously increasing rural peoples’ vulnerability, such as climate change and endemic
non-communicable disease from poor nutrition and diets. Rural populations are
declining. Outmigration and a lack of incentives for young people to remain in rural
areas are leading to farm labour shortages, an aging farmer population and vacant
land tax allotments. This has implications for staple food self-sufficiency in the longer
term and an imbalance in favour of imports.
3. Agriculture accounts for 18 per cent of GDP, 90 per cent of total exports (fisheries
and agriculture) and about 35 per cent of employment. In 2015, 86 per cent of
households were engaged in agriculture and about 70 per cent in fishing. Yet both
sectors have been stagnant since 2011. Much of Tonga’s productive agricultural land
is left uncultivated owing to limited interest in investing in the more isolated areas
due to low profitability. The formal private sector is dominated by services largely
determined by remittance levels, with limited growth potential and purchasing
power. Consequently, the underlying structural constraints on Tonga’s economic
performance, as well as recent global economic developments, have resulted in a
decline in real incomes for many households.
4.
5.
The country is heavily reliant on external finance (primarily development assistance)
and is one of the most remittance-dependent countries in the world. Remittance
inflows were equivalent to US$114 million in 2014 (World Bank 2014) and were sent
by about 30,000 migrants living abroad (United Nations Department of Economic
and Social Affairs [UN DESA] 2015). Almost all Tongan households rely on
remittances from overseas members for a significant proportion of their incomes.
Tonga has the world’s third highest level of risk from disasters, with the effects of
climate change increasing their frequency and intensity. Successive economic shocks
and continued outward migration, along with growing urbanization, continue to place
pressure on traditional and informal social protection systems and to increase the
vulnerability of poor people. Although remittances have reduced poverty, they have
also increased dependency and raised expectations for living standards that are now
difficult to satisfy within traditional Tongan communities.

6.
7.
RB-COSOP
The Tonga Rural Innovation Project II (TRIP II) builds on the success of a first-phase
investment implemented from 2012 to 2017. TRIP I achieved significant results and
policy impact by improving the livelihoods of remote outer island communities
through enhanced community planning and delivery of improved public and private
goods and services. The second phase will scale up this approach nationally and
focus on building resilience to the effects of climate change and extreme weather
events.
TRIP II is aligned with the 2015-2025 Tonga Strategic Development Framework
(TSDF), the current Climate Change Policy, and the Tonga Agriculture-Sector Plan
(TASP). The project supports the TSDF’s outcome B – “a more inclusive, sustainable
and balanced urban and rural development across island groups.” The TSDF
recognizes that: (i) population dispersion across small islands presents challenges
for inclusive development through access to infrastructure and services; and
(ii) there is a need for an improved balance, and thus resource allocation, between
urban and rural development across the island groups. TRIP II will contribute to the
TASP’s goal of maximizing agriculture’s contribution to Tonga’s economic growth and
to food security and nutrition in the face of a changing global economy, climate
change and increased natural disasters.
8.
TRIP II is fully aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025, the Fund’s
strategy for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and its Pacific Partnership
Approach, which aims to enable rural people on Pacific Islands to achieve food
security and sustainable, resilient livelihoods. TRIP II is also aligned with IFAD’s
country strategy note for Tonga.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
9. Project area. While TRIP I focused on the outer islands, TRIP II will have a national
focus, excluding only large urban communities and those with very few households.
10. Target group. The project targets poor women, men and youth living in rural
communities. TRIP II’s targeting strategy combines self-targeting with specific
operational measures that ensure inclusive and equitable processes. It has an
estimated target of 28,650 people in 5,190 households in 122 communities.
B. Project development objective
11. TRIP II aims to contribute to improved and resilient livelihoods for Tonga’s rural
population. Its development objective is to enable communities to plan and manage
resilient infrastructure and livelihood activities (including addressing food security
and nutrition).
C. Components/outcomes
12. Component 1. Community development aims to increase the resilience of
community infrastructure built to required standards. This is a continuation of TRIP
I’s component 1 (also community development), with the objective of covering the
whole country by the end of TRIP II. Subcomponent 1.1 will support preparation of
community development plans (CDPs) in target communities as the basis for
subcomponent 1.2. This second subcomponent will support development of resilient
community infrastructure based on CDPs, with activities focused on the construction,
operation and maintenance of priority small-scale economic infrastructure.
13. Component 2. Sustainable economic livelihoods aims to increase the resilience
of economic livelihoods through climate-smart, nutrition-sensitive agricultural
production systems. Subcomponent 2.1 will support the development of community
agricultural development plans (CADPs), which will include activities to address
2
EB 2017/LOT/P.7
climate change and the expressed wish of communities for support in improving
their economic livelihoods. Subcomponent 2.2 will support farmers engaged in
sustainable economic livelihoods through improved climate-resilient practices to:
(i) improve agroforestry-based food production systems on tax allotments1 and
demonstration farms; (ii) manage more productive homestead gardens; (iii) support
agroforestry production of raw materials for crafts; and (iv) construct weaving halls
for women.
14. Component 3. Project management and coordination aims to enhance project
management capacity for implementation and monitoring of project activities, with
the component’s key output being effective project management.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
15. The TRIP II theory of change is that enhanced community capacity for sustainable
infrastructure planning and development, when linked with investment in resilient
agricultural production systems, will contribute to improved, sustainable livelihoods
for vulnerable households. Building resilience to the effects of climate change and
improving household nutrition are implicit in this approach. The project pursues a
community development approach to expand economic livelihood opportunities
through a combination of empowerment and technical inputs, such as sustainable
resource management and targeted technical services. Project activities are
complementary and, when implemented by target communities, are sequenced to
create synergies for improved, sustainable and climate-smart economic livelihoods.
Building cohesive and united rural communities through component 1 activities
(planning and constructing resilient community infrastructure) will form a platform
on which to design and implement component 2 (sustainable economic livelihoods).
16. TRIP II builds on lessons learned during TRIP I, including: (i) avoiding complexity by
focusing on a few core constraints on agriculture and rural development;
(ii) enhancing component complementarity by focusing on common income-
generating activities combined with the use of targeting mechanisms;
(iii) strengthening and empowering rural communities for a greater influence on
policy, and for engagement with government planning and sector support processes
conducive to sustained community livelihood development; (iv) ensuring that
addressing vulnerability to climate change and to over- and undernutrition is
mainstreamed in all project activities; and (v) minimizing risk by adopting well
proven approaches.
B. Organizational framework
17. The project will adopt the same implementation arrangements that functioned
effectively under TRIP I, with some adjustments in targeting and approach based on
learning. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) will be the
representative of the borrower/recipient. The Mainstreaming of Rural Development
Innovation Tonga Trust (MORDI TT), a locally registered NGO that has been
implementing TRIP I through a memorandum of understanding with MFNP, will be
the lead project agency. It will report to MFNP, and a project advisory committee
(PAC) will be established to guide project implementation in areas of governance,
policy, networking with other organizations and the strategic project overview.
MORDI TT will establish a dedicated project management unit (PMU) to support
project implementation.
18. This arrangement is based on an assessment of MORDI TT’s implementation capacity
and an institutional review done in the design phase. The Trust’s implementation of
TRIP I has: (i) been cost-effective and cost-efficient; (ii) developed a credible
reputation with non-governmental and government agencies (mainstreaming of the
1 Defined as an eight-acre plot of farmland officially registered with the Government and inheritable from father to son.

EB 2017/LOT/P.7
CDP planning process in national government planning processes) – evidenced by
the interest expressed by development partners in funding the priorities identified in
the CDPs; (iii) been instrumental in introducing the concept of CDPs;
(iv) spearheaded the use of town officers as local development agents; and
(v) demonstrated strong results after introducing a systematic process for
community-level planning and development implementation.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
19. Planning. Planning processes within TRIP II will be harmonized with the
government planning process and guided by the CDPs and CADPs developed at the
community level. The project manager, in consultation with town officers, will
prepare a draft annual workplan and budget (AWP/B), submit it to the MORDI TT
board for review and endorsement, and to the PAC for review. Draft AWP/Bs will
then be shared with MFNP and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Forests and
Fisheries (MAFFF), and finally submitted to IFAD for “no objection”.
20. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The M&E system will monitor physical and
financial progress, as well as progress towards project objectives, and will serve as a
key management tool. Inputs, outputs, process and outcomes will be monitored in
accordance with logical framework indicators based on the financial management
system, staff reports and surveys. Special studies will complement this information
through in-depth analysis of topics such as: (i) success factors in mobilizing and
motivating youth; and (ii) strategies for investing remittances in productive local
business opportunities. The PMU will collect baseline data in each targeted
community, in accordance with the guidelines of IFAD’s Results and Impact
Management System (RIMS). All data will be disaggregated by sex and age.
21. Knowledge management. Knowledge management includes: (i) ensuring
engagement with target communities and implementation partners; (ii) establishing
an M&E framework that provides information and analysis for management decision-
making against logical framework indicators and AWP/Bs; (iii) ensuring that
knowledge and results are documented and shared with all stakeholders; and
(iv) continuing the close relationship between MORDI TT and IFAD on a broad range
of knowledge management activities. An addition to TRIP II is the focus on building
partnerships with the objective of providing complete and timely information to key
stakeholders and partners.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
22. Financial management. MFNP will be the representative of the borrower/recipient,
with responsibility for approving the AWP/B after endorsement by the PAC, and will
have overall accountability for the project, including fiduciary aspects. MORDI TT will
be responsible for day-to-day financial management activities, including accounting,
reporting and coordinating audit processes.
23. The inherent fiduciary risk is considered medium in Tonga. Project fiduciary risk was
also assessed as medium during design. Financial management performance was
judged to be moderately satisfactory by the latest supervision mission to TRIP I,
suggesting room for improvement. Financial audits during TRIP I implementation
have been consistently unqualified. However, some weaknesses were observed
during supervision regarding staff turnover, adherence to IFAD's requirements for
disbursement requests and procurement processes.
24. Measures to mitigate fiduciary risk in TRIP II will include: (i) retention of TRIP I
finance staff, subject to performance assessment; (ii) hiring of additional dedicated
finance and procurement staff; (iii) improvement of the existing TRIP I finance and
administration manual, with detailed accounting, procurement and documentation
management processes; (iv) an automated accounting system and associated
training (the current software used for TRIP I will be retained, subject to IFAD
4
EB 2017/LOT/P.7
assessment; alternatively, a new system may be procured at start-up); (v) interim
financial reporting submitted to MFNP and IFAD; (vi) periodic compliance audits by
the Office of the Auditor General, reported to MFNP and IFAD, and focused on
reviews of internal controls and procurement documentation; (vii) audit reports
provided to MFNP and IFAD; and (viii) quarterly internal audits by the Internal Audit
Office of MFNP.
25. The financial statements for TRIP II will be prepared by MORDI TT on a cash
accounting basis, supplemented as necessary by additional data so as to provide
minimum disclosures under international accounting standards.
26. Audit. Independent annual audits will be conducted by the Office of the Auditor
General or a private auditor in line with international auditing standards. The choice
of auditor will be determined within six months of effectiveness. IFAD's prior
experience regarding the quality and timeliness of audits by private auditors during
the implementation of TRIP I has been satisfactory.
27. Flow of funds. A designated account in United States dollars will be opened by
MFNP to receive the loan and grant funding from IFAD. A project account in local
currency will also be opened by MORDI TT to cover day-to-day transactions.
28. Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with national procurement rules and
regulations to the extent that these are consistent with IFAD’s Project Procurement
Guidelines. The Government of Tonga updated its public procurement regulations in
2015. As procurement capacity has been identified as a risk, additional specialist
human resources will be allocated to support efficient and effective procurement
execution.
29. Governance. Tonga has taken steps to improve the qualities of good governance,
accountability, transparency, anticorruption, security and rule of law. As a sign of
commitment, the Government is continuing with reform efforts made under the
Economic Public-Sector Reform Programme to improve the effective provision of
government services by focusing on three areas of public-sector management –
public administration, financial management and enterprise reform. To ensure
effective governance, the project will incorporate the following measures, to be
monitored through a good governance framework: (i) information transparency;
(ii) training and capacity-building; (iii) a complaint mechanism for community
members; (iv) enhanced supervision and monitoring; and (v) zero tolerance towards
fraud and corruption.
E. Supervision
30. TRIP II will be supervised by IFAD on a biannual basis to coincide with the
preparation of AWP/Bs and approval of withdrawal applications. A midterm review
will be undertaken at the end of the third project year. IFAD has strengthened its
presence in the Pacific Islands with a subregional coordinator based at UNDP in
Suva, Fiji. In addition, an IFAD country office has been established in Jakarta,
Indonesia, managed by an outposted country director with responsibility for the
Pacific Islands, allowing for more continuous follow-up and support.
IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
31. The financing gap of US$3.76 million may be sourced by subsequent performance-
based allocation system (PBAS) cycles (under financing terms to be determined and
subject to internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval) or through
cofinancing identified during implementation.
A. Project costs
32. The total project cost is estimated at US$10.91 million over a five-year
implementation period. Indicative component costs are detailed in table 1. Indicative
project costs by expenditure category and financier are provided in table 2. The total
5
EB 2017/LOT/P.7
cost includes physical and price contingencies, which amount to 4 per cent and
3 per cent of base costs, respectively.
33. Project costs have been calculated in prices current in Tonga as of June 2016. The
allowance for price contingencies (3 per cent) is related to projected international
and domestic inflation rates over the implementation period. It is based on projected
inflation for Tonga (Asian Development Bank, mid-2016) and internationally (World
Bank, Manufactures Unit Index (MUI) for G5 countries). Costs have been calculated
in Tongan pa’anga (T$) and United States dollars at an exchange rate of US$1.0 =
T$2.2.
34. Approximately 21 per cent of the total base cost has been allocated to component 1,
community development. Most of this is dedicated to CDPs and resilient community
infrastructure. Component 2, sustainable economic livelihoods, has been allocated
36 per cent of base costs, with most being allocated to supporting economic
livelihoods in the form of grants. Component 3, project management and
coordination, is estimated at 43 per cent of base costs and includes provision for
technical and policy support, monitoring, evaluation and knowledge activities, and
project staffing, with a significant government contribution for local government staff
assigned to the project. The IFAD loan and grant will collectively finance
25.2 per cent of component 3. To expedite early implementation, IFAD will finance
eligible start-up costs up to a limit of US$125,000.

B. Project financing
35. Tonga is classified as “yellow” under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).
Accordingly, IFAD funding will be provided at 50 per cent in the form of a loan and
50 per cent in the form of a DSF grant. The total project cost of about
US$10.91 million will be financed by: IFAD, for a total amount of some US$3 million
(27.5 per cent of total cost), beneficiary contributions of US$1.43 million
(13 per cent of total cost) and a government contribution of US$2.73 million
(25 per cent of total cost). A financing gap of US$3.76 million may be funded by
subsequent PBAS cycles (under financing terms to be determined and subject to
internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval) or through
cofinancing identified during implementation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
36. Benefits will derive from: (i) reduced loss of life, repair costs, and transport and
communication costs associated with new and improved climate-resilient
infrastructure; (ii) increased household incomes from agricultural (annual and
perennial crops) and craft production; (iii) improved community organization,
empowerment and quality of life in remote communities; and (iv) improved food
security and nutrition. The project benefits a total of 6,349 households or 35,538
beneficiaries.
37. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the project is 20 per cent and the net
present value at a discount rate of 12 per cent is US$8 million. Sensitivity analyses
were completed based on changes in costs and benefits (marginal change and
accrual of benefits over time). An increase in costs of up to 30 per cent decreases
the EIRR to 16 per cent – the same impact as delaying benefits by two years. An
increase in benefits of 20 per cent changes the EIRR to 22 per cent, while a decrease
in benefits of 20 per cent changes the EIRR to 17 per cent.
D. Sustainability
38. Sustainability of project benefits for TRIP I households was high. TRIP II will further
scale up improved and sustainable livelihoods of vulnerable rural communities by:
(i) assisting beneficiaries in community and household planning and prioritization
processes; (ii) involving beneficiaries in development, financing, operation and
maintenance of community economic infrastructure, and sustainable livelihood
investments; (iii) linking beneficiaries with markets, microfinance services and
improved farmer field schools and agricultural extension services; and
(iv) embedding participating and learning methods in CDPs, CADPs and government
processes and systems.
39. MORDI TT is an independent NGO that has acquired significant experience and
recognition through successful implementation of the first phase of the TRIP. The
fact that the Government has agreed to partner with civil society (and vice versa) to
deliver TRIP II remains innovative in the Tongan context. The project will ensure
that this relationship is developed further, so that, by completion, the capacity to
further support and develop Tonga’s rural sector is enhanced and embedded in
national systems.
7
EB 2017/LOT/P.7
E. Risk identification and mitigation
40. TRIP II is considered a relatively low-risk investment, as the design scales up a
proven approach to supporting the development of remote rural communities. Main
risks include: (i) remoteness, and transport and communication obstacles; (ii) lack
of finance for community economic infrastructure and sustainable livelihoods; (iii) a
declining population and migration of youth and able-bodied people; (iv) non-
conducive land tenure systems under which land and tax allotments are allocated to
elder male heirs and are often abandoned and unproductive; (v) climate change
impact, including extreme weather events; (vi) MORDI TT staff retention;
(vii) fiduciary risk relating to adherence to financial management and procurement
processes; and (viii) inability of MAFFF to fulfil its role of providing extension officers
for farmer field schools and related extension activities. Mitigation strategies have
been developed during the design and include: (i) realistically designed activities and
targets; (ii) specific targeting of income-generating activities; (iii) capacity-building
and awareness-raising; (iv) strengthened project management and collaboration
with relevant government agencies; and (v) financial management and procurement
arrangements to mitigate fiduciary risk.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
41. TRIP is fully aligned with the goals and objectives of the IFAD Strategic Framework
2016-2025, IFAD’s strategy for SIDS, and other relevant policies and strategies,
including those for targeting, gender equality and women’s empowerment, the
environment and natural resource management, and climate change. In addition,
TRIP II has developed an explicit scaling up pathway – an area of strategic
importance to IFAD.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
42. The project is aligned with a number of key policies and contributes to Government
priorities. Strategic partnerships between MORDI TT and various partners and
external service providers were integral to the success of TRIP I and will thus form
an integral part of TRIP II implementation, for example with: (i) the Pacific Risk
Resilience Programme, for support to introducing climate change and disaster risk
concepts into infrastructure planning; (ii) the private sector, for development and
testing of extension approaches; and (iii) the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, to increase awareness of the impacts of climate change and
natural disasters on farming practices.
43. MORDI TT has also built strategic partnerships with a number of agencies and
organizations in Tonga, particularly with MFNP, which is responsible for development
planning, coordination and financing. TRIP II will promote partnerships with:
(i) MAFFF and the Ministries of Education and Women’s Affairs; Labour, Commerce,
Trade and Industries; and Training, Sports, Youth and Employment;
(ii) representatives of development partners (e.g. the Asian Development Bank and
World Bank; Australia and the New Zealand Aid Programme); and (iii)
representatives of the private sector (e.g. commercial vanilla and vegetable growers
and exporters) that work in rural development in Tonga. A feature of TRIP II will be
a strengthened and more formal partnership with MAFFF for the provision of farmer
extension services and tree seedlings, with the objective of developing extension
packages and good practice modules for national adoption and use by MAFFF and
others beyond the project. A close and ongoing partnership with the Ministry of
Internal Affairs, which employs cooperating town and district officers, will be
essential. These strategic partnerships, particularly those with the Ministries of
Education and Women’s Affairs and of Training, Sports, Youth and Employment will
ensure that TRIP II receives continuous strategic support and monitoring to further
social, economic and gender inclusion objectives.

EB 2017/LOT/P.7
Innovations and scaling up
C.
44. The design of TRIP II promotes innovation in rural empowerment and livelihood
development, including: (i) impact on policy and local governance through
collaboration with the Ministry of Internal Affairs; (ii) identifying and implementing
strategic partnerships with, for example: (a) NGOs (Live & Learn Environmental
Education), the Pacific Risk Resilience Programme and the Tonga Business Enterprise
Centre; (iii) the negotiated partnership between the Government, IFAD and
MORDI TT, which has proven to be one of the most effective in the country; and
(iv) responding to challenges encountered in TRIP I’s component 2 with an
innovative smallholder package of: (a) farmer field schools for training and learning;
(b) short value-chain analysis to define local and import replacement markets;
(c) appropriately timed microfinance support from South Pacific Business
Development; (d) provision of farming inputs; and, importantly, (e) ensuring that
the designs of community infrastructure and livelihood development activities
contain interventions and responses that address the looming impact of climate
change and increased natural disasters.
45. Once TRIP II is completed, it is expected that 122 rural communities in Tonga will be
empowered with CDPs, which will be the basis of community development across all
island groups. In addition, about 60 rural communities will develop CADPs. These
powerful and community-embedded plans should thus form the basis for a further
scaling up of the TRIP II economic livelihoods initiative. A scaling up pathway has
been developed as part of project design.
Policy engagement
D.
46. TRIP I achieved significant policy impact. TRIP II will continue to promote an
enabling environment for rural communities by addressing procedural and policy
issues that affect inclusive development, including through: (i) working with public
partners to integrate the development planning process into formal government
processes; (ii) establishing partnerships that support inclusion objectives (e.g. for
rural finance, nurseries and materials); (iii) piloting approaches tailored to the
specific constraints and resources of the Tongan community (e.g. using social media,
digital extension services and capture of remittance investment); and (iv) seeking
practical solutions to policy constraints, such as land legislation that reduces the
access of both women and younger siblings.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
47. A project financing agreement between the Kingdom of Tonga and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.
48. The Kingdom of Tonga is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.
49. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
