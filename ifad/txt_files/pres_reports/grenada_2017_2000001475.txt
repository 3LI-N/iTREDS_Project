Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to Grenada for the Climate-smart Agriculture and Rural Enterprise Programme,
as contained in paragraph 63.
Proposed loan to Grenada for the Climate-smart
Agriculture and Rural Enterprise Programme
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
Grenada is an upper-middle-income small island developing state (SIDS), with a
per capita GDP of about US$13,400. Its population of 110,096 (2015) lives in an
area of 344 km2 (95 per cent on the main island of Grenada and 5 per cent on the
two smaller islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique). Over 90 per cent of the
population is considered rural (excepting residents of the capital town of
St. George’s).
2.

4.
5.
6.
As a small island, Grenada is highly vulnerable to external shocks and
climate-change (CC) effects. After being devastated by hurricanes in 2004 and
2005, its tourism sector suffered a slump in the wake of the global financial crisis
of 2008.
Poverty, unemployment and youth. Approximately 38 per cent of Grenada’s
population lives below the poverty line (2.4 per cent are considered indigent), and
a further 14 per cent are highly vulnerable. In rural areas particularly, private
investment is scarce and access to government programmes is limited.
Unemployment (32-38 per cent) is a concern for rural communities, particularly
among youth (37,540 young men and women from 15 to 34 years of age), whose
unemployment rates are above 40 per cent (even higher in the case of women).
Agriculture sector and nutrition. Grenada is a net food importer; roughly
80 per cent of the food it consumes is not produced domestically. According to the
Grenada Agricultural Census, in 2012 there were 9,200 farmers and 1,500 fishers
(mostly men); 80 per cent of the farmers were smallholders and over 70 per cent
were men. Agriculture and fishery activities account for 5.0-9.5 per cent of GDP,
although they generate a significant share of exports (fish contribute 25 per cent of
total exports, and nutmeg and mace 23 per cent).
Owing to a heavy reliance on cheap food imports, the poor have switched to a less
healthy diet. This trend, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, lends itself to obesity
and to a higher prevalence of nutrition-related non-communicable diseases, such
as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease and cancer.
In recent years, the Government of Grenada has put a high priority on the
agriculture sector, approving several policies to stimulate local production (such as
the “eat local, buy local‟ campaign) and to reduce internal barriers (such as high
feed costs in the poultry sector and barriers limiting access to agricultural land).
The National Agriculture Policy identifies priority commodities and classifies them
according to their usefulness in increasing food security, exports, supplies to the
tourism industry and import substitution. Most of the crop and livestock products
identified – including fruit, vegetables, roots and tubers, poultry, pigs and goats –
are produced by smallholders.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and the
7.
8.
9.
country strategy note
Rationale and alignment with government priorities. Grenada’s structural
transformation from an agriculture-based economy to a service-based one has
generated heavy dependency on food imports, and has caused abandonment of
agricultural land areas and high levels of unemployment in rural areas, particularly
among young people. The Government’s national development policies have two
major priorities for the rural sector: (i) job creation and youth empowerment; and
(ii) climate-smart agriculture (CSA), to improve farmers’ resilience to the effects of
climate change. The proposed new programme is designed to assist the
Government in pursuing these priorities.
Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the country
strategy note (CSN). In terms of the SDGs, the new programme is expected to
contribute mainly to SDG1 (end poverty); SDG2 (achieve food security and
improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture); SDG8 (promote
sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive
employment, and decent work for all) and SDG10 (reduce inequality within and
among countries).1
The new programme is also aligned with IFAD’s CSN, which has the overall
strategic goal of reducing the vulnerability of the rural poor to economic and
climate shocks by promoting agricultural and non-agricultural employment
opportunities and CC adaptation practices.
10. Theory of change. The design of the new programme is founded on promoting
new business start-ups run by young people with a strong entrepreneurial drive.
These start-ups will target market opportunities for products and services arising
from the adoption of CSA approaches, building CC resilience and thus increasing
the prospects for sustainability. This requires an entrepreneurial drive and business
approach that are scarce among an aging farming community in rural areas. By
attracting youth into agriculture and promoting rural start-ups, with technology-
driven approaches, and putting the required financial and technical support
services in place, the programme is expected to provide the missing links that are
currently preventing income growth among poor rural people.
11.
IFAD’s role. While IFAD is a smaller player than some other international financial
institutions in the region (such as the World Bank, Inter-American Development
Bank and CDB), its rural-sector expertise gives it a comparative advantage in:
targeting poor rural people, supporting rural communities and agricultural
development projects, strengthening rural enterprises, teaching participatory
approaches and promoting gender equity and market-driven business
development.
II. Programme description
A. Programme area and target group
12. Geographical coverage. The programme area will encompass rural communities
in all seven parishes of Grenada (six on the main island and the single parish that
spans the two islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique). Apart from the capital
town of St. George’s, all other parishes are considered rural. The latest population
census (2011) estimated the rural population at about 107,000 inhabitants (35,600
households).
13. Target group. The overall target group of the new programme includes: (i) poor
rural households (both extremely poor and poor, approximately 13,900
1 Inequality  in  Grenada  is  above  the Caribbean  average. According  to the Caribbean  Development  Bank (CDB),  the
most affluent 10 per cent of Grenadians account for 30 per cent of consumption, while the poorest 10 per cent account
for just 3 per cent. In the 2008 Country Poverty Assessment, the GINI index was estimated at 0.38.
2
EB 2017/LOT/P.23
households); (ii) rural less-poor, but vulnerable (approximately 5,000 households);
and (iii) small-scale farmers (approximately 2,700 households with access to a
maximum of 7 acres of farmland, of whom at least 80 per cent have access to no
more than 2.5 acres).
14. The chief characteristics of poor rural households are: (i) more than the national
average number of family members per household (i.e. more than three); (ii) one
or more unemployed persons among adult family members; (iii) one or more adult
family members without a secondary or tertiary education; and (iv) the head of the
household is single.
15. A total of 7,500 poor rural households are expected to benefit directly from the
programme’s activities: some 4,500 households will receive technical and financial
support services, while 3,000 will benefit from renovated rural roads and drainage
works.
16. Youth and gender targets. Roughly 75 per cent of beneficiaries are expected to
be young people, and approximately 50 per cent will be women, with priority being
given to young women heads of households (single mothers). The programme
envisages affirmative action to attain these targets.
B. Programme development objective
17. The programme’s development objective is to improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods
through access to new jobs, business start-ups or consolidation of new businesses
and adoption of CSA practices.
18. The programme’s expected impacts are: 4,500 poor households reporting an
income increase of at least 10 per cent; (ii) 400 farmers with greater resilience
(reporting adoption of at least one CSA practice); and (iii) 400 new jobs created.
C. Components/outcomes
19. The programme will be implemented through two technical components –
(i) enterprise business development (EBD) and (ii) CSA – and one programme
management component. While each technical component has its specific focus,
target population and implementation arrangements, there will be many
opportunities to develop synergies during the implementation phase. The CSA
component will secure and improve the supply and quality of agricultural goods,
providing grounds for microenterprise consolidation in the long term and creating
opportunities for businesses along the value chain under the EBD component.
20. Component 1: EBD. The objective of this component is to support ongoing and
start-up businesses in rural areas through technical services and financing. Access
to support services to develop a business idea and build the capacities needed to
become sustainable is currently limited. This component will seek to make these
services more readily available, promoting innovation and the engagement of
young people in the most promising sectors of the rural economy, including both
farming and non-farming activities. The expected outcomes of this component are
(i) 120 new enterprises created/consolidated; and (ii) 400 new jobs created.
21. Component 2: CSA. The objective of this component is to increase the resilience
of small-scale farmers to the anticipated above-average temperatures and
below-average dry-season rainfall, meaning longer drought periods. The
component will thus promote the adoption of more efficient water management
and conservation measures, as a key activity for responding to changing rainfall
patterns. The component will also finance backyard gardens with CSA approaches
to improve food security and nutrition among the most vulnerable population
groups. The expected outcomes of this component are (i) 400 farmers increasing
their production by an average of 20 per cent; and (ii) 3,000 farmers reporting
improved physical access to markets.
3
EB 2017/LOT/P.23
22. Component 3: Programme management. This component aims to ensure the
programme’s effectiveness and efficiency by setting up key management systems
and processes that will achieve the expected outcomes and outputs with the funds
provided. Monitoring and evaluation activities are part of this component.
III. Programme implementation
A.
Approach
23. The implementation approach is based on five principles: (i) a demand-driven
approach to selecting the activities and services to be supported by the
programme; (ii) shortening the lengthy preparation period that characterized
previous IFAD projects in Grenada, drawing on the lessons learned and capacities
built under the earlier Market Access and Rural Enterprises programme;
(iii) improving contractual arrangements with implementing partners to empower
these partners in achieving the programme’s objectives and targets – fostering
accountability; (iv) strengthening specific areas within the main service providers,
to ensure high-quality and timely support services to beneficiaries; and
(v) ensuring youth and social inclusion and gender equality through affirmative
action. The programme has a proposed duration of six years.
B. Organizational framework
24. The programme’s executing agency will be the Ministry of Finance (MoF); and it will
be implemented through a programme management unit (PMU) set up within MoF.
The PMU will be responsible for the core services of accounting and financial
management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and technical coordination.
25. The PMU will have a reduced staff, since activities will be performed by specialized
implementing partners with which memorandums of understanding will be signed.
The technical capacity of the selected implementing partners is considered
adequate, based on their expertise and technical skills and/or on the experience of
their previous involvement in IFAD projects.
26.
Lastly, a programme steering committee (PSC) will be created, on which key
stakeholders will be represented. The committee will play an overall guidance role,
defining the main strategies and approving the programme operational manual,
agreements and contracts with service providers, the annual workplan and budget
(AWP/B), M&E reports and others submitted by the PMU for adequate supervision
and guidance.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
27. Monitoring and evaluation. M&E will be participatory, with stakeholders fully
engaged in the collection, discussion and analysis of field data and in decision-
making on changes that might be necessary for more effective or efficient
programme implementation. This means that key implementers will play an active
role in data collection, whereas the PMU will monitor the overall progress of the
programme. The PMU will provide feedback on progress to the PSC and key
implementers, and these actors will jointly decide on any corrective measures that
might be required.
28. Knowledge management. Specific evidence-based knowledge products will be
developed from programme experiences, to extract lessons and best practices,
replicate innovative solutions, achieve better outcomes and greater impact from
the development resources, and strategically disseminate the knowledge generated
to support national decision-making and policy processes. The knowledge products
to be generated by the PMU and its implementing partners include: working
papers, case studies, research reports, videos, blogs and vlogs, and policy briefs.
At the end of the programme, the PMU will organize and implement closing
4
EB 2017/LOT/P.23
workshops in Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique to discuss experiences and
results with stakeholders.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
29. Financial management. MoF, acting through the PMU, is assigned overall
fiduciary responsibility as the lead programme agency, and will thus ensure proper
financial management and implementation of the programme. MoF has prior
experience in managing IFAD projects and is familiar with the Fund’s policies and
requirements for drawing on this financing and for financial accountability.
Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2016 rated Grenada’s
inherent risk low, giving it a score of 56 which placed it 46th of 176 countries rated.
The financial management risk for this programme is rated medium, due mainly to
the need to: ensure that regular internal audits are carried out, establish
appropriate segregation of duties, improve preparation and monitoring of AWP/Bs
and strengthen controls over activities in the regions.
30. Accounting and accounting system. Programme accounting will use the
QuickBooks accounting system alongside the Standard Integrated Government
Financial Information System (SIGFIS), which is used by all ministries and
development projects in Grenada. SIGFIS is currently being upgraded to make it
possible to configure reports that satisfy IFAD requirements. Once the upgrade and
respective training have been completed successfully, the QuickBooks system will
be discontinued.
31. Financial reporting. Pursuant to IFAD requirements, annual financial statements
will be prepared and submitted using International Public Sector Accounting
Standards, including information by category of expenditure, component and
financing source.
32. Audits. The MoF Internal Audit Department will include the new programme in its
internal audit plans, which will enable it to undertake reviews and submit findings
to the PSC and IFAD. The external audit will be performed in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), including ISA 701, by independent
auditors acceptable to IFAD. The audit report and related management letter are to
be submitted to the Fund within six months of each fiscal year-end.
33. Flow of funds. In accordance with Grenada’s Public Financial Management Acts of
2014 and 2015, the funds from IFAD, CDB and the Government will be channelled
to the single treasury account held in the Grenada Cooperative Bank. Funds will be
traced through coded designated ledger accounts, and regular reconciliations will
be performed.
34. Procurement. Procurement under the programme will be carried out by the PMU
in accordance with provisions of the loan agreement, IFAD guidelines and the
programme operational manual. Overall procurement risk is rated medium, in view
of existing capacity and the programme’s implementation arrangements.
35. Governance. The PSC will play a fiduciary oversight role, including approval of
AWP/B submissions, discussion of key internal and external audit findings, review
of programme progress and communication with all parties to ensure smooth and
active implementation of activities from year to year.
E. Supervision
36.
IFAD will supervise the programme directly, complemented by implementation
support missions, the first of which will be undertaken during the first year of
programme implementation. Key features to be assessed and monitored during
this mission include: PMU staffing; programme start-up; understanding and
application of targeting criteria; development of the AWP/B and procurement plan;
progress in relation to the time frame defined in the implementation plan; progress
on memorandums of understanding with key implementation partners;
5
EB 2017/LOT/P.23
development of the baseline study, M&E and management information system;
development of the programme operational manual; and progress on fiduciary
issues, expenditures, contribution of funds from the counterparties, and fulfilment
of the terms of the loan agreement.
37. A midterm review will be take place no later than the midpoint of the
implementation period, to assess progress towards achievement of logical
framework indicators, programme objectives and outcomes.
F. Exceptions to the General Conditions for Agricultural
Development Financing and IFAD’s operating policies
38. Retroactive financing. As an exception to section 4.08(a)(ii) of the General
Conditions, up to US$400,000 equivalent in specific eligible expenses incurred and
prefinanced by the Government during the preparatory period (from the first day of
negotiations until the financing agreement’s entry into force), will be reimbursed
from the IFAD loan after the financing agreement has entered into force and any
conditions precedent to withdrawal have been met. The following expenditure
categories are eligible for retroactive financing: (i) vehicles, equipment and
materials; (ii) consulting services, training and technical assistance; (iii) salaries
and allowances; and (iv) operating costs. Activities to be financed retroactively,
and their respective expenditure categories and financing sources, will require
IFAD’s prior “no objection‟ to be considered eligible.
IV. Programme costs, financing and benefits
A. Programme costs
39. The base cost of the programme is estimated at US$11.29 million, with physical
and price contingencies representing US$710,000 (about 6 per cent). The
exchange rate used for calculations is US$1 = 2.7 East Caribbean dollars. Physical
contingencies have been calculated at 10 per cent for selected expenditure
accounts, while inflation was estimated at 2.6 per cent per annum for both
imported and local products. Value added tax has been applied to nearly all goods
and services at the current level of 15 per cent.
B. Programme financing
40. The programme will be financed as follows: (i) a highly concessional IFAD loan of
US$3.99 million (33 per cent of total programme costs); (ii) a CDB loan under the
Special Development Fund of US$3.00 million (25 per cent of the total); (iii) a non-
refundable contribution by the Grenada Investment Development Corporation
(GIDC) of US$330,000; (iv) counterpart contributions by the Government
estimated at US$2.00 million (17 per cent of the total); (v) contributions in cash
and in kind by the final beneficiaries worth US$270,000; and (vi) a financing gap of
US$2.41 million (20 per cent of the total).
41. The financing gap may be sourced from the subsequent IFAD performance-based
allocation system cycle (under financing terms to be determined, subject to
internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval), or by further
cofinancing by CDB or another international financial institution operating in
Grenada. The programme has been designed to be sustainable and stand-alone,
even in the remote eventuality that the funding gap is not covered, in which case
outreach would be reduced.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
42.
In terms of benefits, programme interventions aim to reduce unemployment rates
(mainly among young people) and increase family income generation, wages and
new business incomes in rural areas.
43. The following quantitative benefits have been considered for component 1
activities: (i) for vocational skills training, at least a 20 per cent increase in
expected future wages; (ii) for smaller grants (e.g. landscaping and birdwatching
activities), income growth of at least 17 per cent; and (iii) for larger business
grants (e.g. fisheries, health care and wellness, a shade-house for lettuce and
agroprocessing of jellies and jams), at least a 23 per cent increase in income.
44.
For component 2 (climate-smart agriculture): (i) a 17 per cent increase in income
for a typical farmer improving resilience and yields with water-harvesting
technologies; (ii) a 26 per cent increase in income for innovative CSA shade-
houses; and (iii) a 52 per cent increase in a participant’s income from small-
ruminant CSA initiatives.
45. The financial analysis considered the costs and benefits of the programme’s nine
models over a 15-year period. All models are profitable at a 9 per cent discount
rate, with a financial internal rate of return ranging from 9.3 per cent to 85.5 per
cent.
46. The economic analysis used economic prices to calculate total costs and benefits,
and an economic discount rate of 6 per cent. In addition to the benefits mentioned
in the financial analysis, externalities deriving from restoration of rural roads, in
the form of time savings for users, were also included. The analysis yielded an
economic internal rate of return of 11.47 per cent, with a net present value of
US$3.34 million.
D. Sustainability
47. Political and institutional sustainability. The programme is aligned with the
Government’s top priorities. Implementation arrangements will involve public-
sector institutional partners providing the type of support services offered through
the programme, as core responsibilities, and that are committed to maintaining the
programme’s activities after the completion date.
48. Financial sustainability. The programme will promote start-up businesses and
put entrepreneurs and young people in contact with formal financial markets. The
Grenada Development Bank and credit unions will participate in selecting matching
grants. The programme will promote record-keeping activities in the new
businesses – crucial for establishing a track record and gaining access to finance in
the long term.
49. Environmental sustainability. The programme’s CSA component will enhance
the environmental sustainability of the agriculture sector. By promoting business-
smart CSA and ensuring adequate maintenance activities, it is expected that
farmers will adopt CSA practices on a sustainable basis.
8
E. Risk identification and mitigation
50. The main risks identified and corresponding mitigation measures are described in
the following table.
EB 2017/LOT/P.23
Main risks
Economic risk: Grenada’s
vulnerability, as a SIDS, to
external shocks, particularly
fluctuations in tourist arrivals,
which could reduce demand for
businesses promoted by the
programme.
Level of risk: moderate
CC risks: Higher temperatures
and more erratic rainfall patterns
could undermine the production
gains achieved during
programme implementation and
cause production losses.
Level of risk: moderate
Social risks: The programme’s
capacity to reach the most
vulnerable sectors of the target
population (unemployed single
mothers and at-risk youth
susceptible to juvenile
delinquency) unable to come
forward to benefit from
programme opportunities.
Level of risk: moderate to low
(decreasing over time)
Institutional risks: Service
providers’ capacity to target the
right beneficiaries and provide
quality, timely support.
Level of risk: moderate
Mitigation strategy
- Small businesses will be promoted that are linked to
agriculture, agroprocessing and related services and
have the capacity to supply the domestic market.
- Higher yields and quality control will be supported to
gain competitiveness against imported products.
- High-quality technical support services will
contribute to increased competitiveness and instil
entrepreneurial drive.
- Different CSA practices and technologies will be
tested and fostered to improve resilience.
- Smallholder access to local markets will be improved
to provide an economic incentive for CSA adoption
and food processing.
- Most of the opportunities will be made available to
the target group through public calls for proposals.
- SAEP implementation will mainstream enabling
measures, including affirmative action when
required, designed to empower the most vulnerable
groups and create an enabling environment for their
participation.
-
-
-
-
In order to counteract young people’s lack of interest
in farming, the SAEP will only promote profitable
activities. Young men and women will be enabled to
identify the best opportunities for increasing income
sustainably through the capacity-building process.
The PMU will monitor beneficiary participation by
gender and age, taking affirmative action when
necessary to correct imbalances, so that risk will
decrease during implementation.
The roles and responsibilities of the PMU and
institutional partners will be clearly defined, vesting
full implementation responsibility in the service
providers.
Institutional partners will participate in planning and
will include activities and targets in their own
workplans.
- Contractual arrangements will be performance-
based; payments will be approved and processed
according to status reports; and beneficiaries will be
involved in monitoring the quality of services at
various levels.

V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
51. Overall, the programme is compliant with: (i) the IFAD Rural Enterprise Policy,
which encourages IFAD to follow a holistic approach to enable entrepreneurial poor
people to access various business support services; (ii) the Targeting Policy, by
applying self-targeting (through participation in training courses and grant
requests) and social targeting (focused on women and youth); (iii) the Policy on
Improving Access to Land and Tenure Security, by promoting policy dialogue on
land access; and (iv) the Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment,
through affirmative action to close the gender gap and increase women’s
participation.
52. Environmental and social category. In accordance with IFAD's Social,
Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures (SECAP), the programme is
considered to pose moderate socio-environmental risks, and can be classified as
category B, as it targets existing farms and promotes CSA practices, organic
farming and/or integrated pest management.
53. Climate-risk category. According to the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index,
Grenada is ranked 61st of 181 countries, in a ranking system in which countries are
listed in reverse order of vulnerability. Safeguards against climate vulnerabilities
are incorporated into the programme by promoting CSA practices that provide a
buffer against extreme weather events and reduce the risk of crop failure. Based
on the above, Grenada’s climate risk classification is moderate.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
54. Alignment with the growth and poverty reduction strategy (GPRS). The
programme is aligned with the 2014-2018 GPRS, in which the top priorities are
economic growth and job creation.
55. Synergies and harmonization with the programmes of other donors. The
programme will seek to develop synergy with the Integrated CC Adaptation
Strategies, funded by the German Agency for international Cooperation (GIZ),
which aims to build capacity at diverse levels to mainstream CC issues in policies
and community initiatives, and will finalize operations at the end of 2018. It will
also seek synergy with the Regional Agricultural Competitiveness Project of the
Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), recently approved by the World
Bank. That project targets the development of agricultural value chains in Grenada
and St. Vincent (some US$4 million for Grenada) and will begin operations by end-
2017. It promotes the development of competitive clusters in the agriculture and
fisheries sectors, involving key players in each value chain. The new IFAD
operation could complement this by enabling poor farmers to participate in the new
value chains.
C.
Innovations and scaling up
56. The SAEP will include innovations that could be scaled up and replicated at the
national level. An important innovation is the promotion of an agricultural
extension scheme based on a public/private partnership, which will encourage the
Government to explore alternatives to the existing model of exclusively public
extension services.
57. The programme will also pioneer the mainstreaming of nutrition education in
schools, extension services and training, generating valuable lessons for addressing
the negative effects of changes in nutritional habits. In addition, it will introduce
backyard gardens as a way to improve nutrition and allow home-based single
mothers to engage in a productive economic activity.
10
EB 2017/LOT/P.23
58.
Lastly, the programme’s key technical elements could be replicated in other OECS
countries that face similar problems (in terms of youth unemployment, reliance on
food imports and vulnerability to climate change and variability).
D.
Policy engagement
59. The following topics are considered of interest in promoting policy dialogue with the
Government: (i) the programme’s innovative mechanism to develop extension
services in rural areas; (ii) access to land for women and young people;
(iii) development of renewable energy sources to reduce energy costs in rural
areas; and (iv) the concessions scheme to import and ensure access to affordable
agricultural equipment for poor rural people.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
60. A programme financing agreement between Grenada and IFAD will constitute the
legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower. A copy of
the negotiated financing agreement is attached as an appendix.
61. Grenada is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.
62.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
63.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
Grenada in the amount of three million nine hundred and ninety thousand
United States dollars (US$3,990,000), and upon such terms and conditions as
shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented
herein.
