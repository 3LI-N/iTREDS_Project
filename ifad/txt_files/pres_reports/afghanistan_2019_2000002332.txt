National context.
Afghanistan’s economy experienced a severe economic slowdown from 2012, followed
by an upturn of 1.3 per cent (2015) and 2.6 per cent (2017), before dropping again
to 2.2 per cent growth in 2018. The persistent uncertainty of the political and security
environment continues to undermine private sector confidence and affect economic
activity. The long drought also impacted the volatile agriculture sector, resulting in a
significant decrease of crop production across the nation. Since 2001 – despite
improvements in life expectancy, incomes and literacy – the majority of the
population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water access,
electricity, medical care and employment.
Predominantly agrarian, almost 80 per cent of Afghanistan’s population is fully reliant
on agriculture and livestock. The agriculture sector employs nearly 63 per cent of the
labour force, contributes about one fourth of GDP and is ranked as the second largest
sector after services. The key commodities are wheat, corn, barley, rice, cotton, fresh
and dried fruits, nuts, karakul pelts, carpets, wool and mutton.
The Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework 2017–2021 is a key
document that aims for self-reliance and holistically encompasses development goals,
key reforms and investment priorities. In addition, the National Comprehensive
Agriculture Development Priority Programme 2016–2021 provides the strategic
framework for agriculture sector development and reforms.
Special aspects relating to IFAD’s corporate mainstreaming priorities
Poverty. Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and 75 per cent of
its population lives in rural areas. It is estimated that 45 per cent of the poor rely on
agriculture for their livelihood. Sluggish growth of GDP and a decline in agricultural
production have continuously pushed up poverty, with the national poverty rate rising
from 38 per cent in 2011 to 55 per cent in 2017.1 With 84 per cent of the poor living
in rural areas, poverty remains predominantly a rural phenomenon.
Gender. Afghanistan’s levels of gender inequality are among the highest in the world
(Gender Inequality Index: 0.635), it being ranked 153rd out of 159 countries.2 The
country also has one of the world’s lowest female labour participation rates, at 19.5
per cent.3 Gender has been one of the most politicized issues in Afghanistan. Women
continue to face disadvantages in access to land, productive resources, social services
and opportunities, political participation and financial services.
Youth. Afghanistan is young in demographic terms. The share of population younger
than 15 is nearly 48 per cent, while those under 25 years of age are around 65 per
cent. Major challenges for youth include the inability to secure employment, mainly
due to a lack of access to education, training, skills development and resources.
Nutrition. Current levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in Afghanistan are
alarming. In 2017, approximately 10.4 million people (more than 30 per cent of the
total population) were reported as being food-insecure.4 Afghanistan has one of the
1 Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey.

world’s highest rates of stunting in children under five, at 41 per cent.5 Poor nutrition
is more severe in provinces with high rates of insurgency-related violence.6
8.
9.
Climate change. Afghanistan is considered highly vulnerable to the effects of climate
change.7 The extreme climate events projected are droughts, extreme rainfall/flows,
flash floods, heat waves and dust storms.
In line with the mainstreaming commitments of the Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s
Resources, the Arghandab Integrated Water Resources Development Project
(AIWRDP) has been classified as:
☒ Climate-focused.
10. The project will address climate vulnerabilities through improving water resource
availability and management.
11.
Rationale for IFAD involvement
In support of overall water resource development in the Arghandab sub-basin, the
project will result in sustainable availability and efficient use of irrigation water,
enhanced productivity levels, and improved market linkages – as a means to
contribute to increasing jobs and economic growth, as well as improving food and
nutrition security.
12. The IFAD Strategy for Engagement in Countries with Fragile Situations
(EB 2016/119/R.4) states that in more challenging contexts, partnerships can help
IFAD to stay engaged, and that partnerships with other international financial
institutions should be prioritized. Considering that IFAD does not have a Country
Office nor other resources available on the ground, the decision to partner with the
Asian Development Bank (AsDB), adopting a complementary approach, will enable it
to have a greater multiplier impact while working with communities on long-term
development programmes.
13. While AsDB focuses its investment on hard infrastructure, the complementary IFAD
financing (and experience) serves as a catalyst to promote a more integrated
intervention, establishing the appropriate linkages between infrastructure
development, community schemes and services, and longer-term and sustainable
agricultural and natural resource management. In addition, IFAD will play a crucial
role in assuring the involvement of smallholders and vulnerable groups, such as
women and youth.
B. Lessons learned
14. Community participation. The Community Livestock and Agriculture Programme
(CLAP) and the Support to National Priority Programme 2 (SNaPP2) demonstrate that
community development committees and water user associations (WUAs) are a
crucial entry point and strategy for participatory development, particularly in
management and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. The community
development committees have proven to be cost-effective and pragmatic, especially
in mitigating security risks and improving water resources management. Institutional
strengthening at the grass-roots level (such as with WUAs) is foreseen to enhance the
sustainability of the rehabilitated infrastructure, and leverages contributions by the
community to asset management as an active partner, together with public sector
entities.
15. Community contracting. The proposed approach of community contracting and
matching grants, taken from IFAD’s CLAP and SNaPP2, have been essential elements
of AIWRDP.

16. Project management. It has been learned from the ongoing portfolio that it is more
efficient to implement the project through a dedicated project management unit
(PMU) than through the regular channel of the ministries. Thus in AIWRDP key
functions such as monitoring and evaluation, procurement, financial management and
human resources will be defined under a dedicated PMU, to increase transparency,
effectiveness and efficiency. The role of the Ministry of Finance as the executing
agency and chair of the project steering committee will also strengthen project
management and coordination functions.
II. Project description
A. Objectives, geographic area of intervention and target groups
17. Objectives. The project’s goal is to increase employment opportunities for the target
population and stimulate GDP growth, while its developmental objective is to improve
management and use of water resources in the Arghandab River sub-basin. The
project is fully aligned with the overall objective of the current Afghanistan country
strategy note.
18. Project area. The geographic project target areas are the predefined irrigation
command areas of the Arghandab irrigation system (AIS), with a total area of
115,000 ha, served by 120 community irrigation systems.
19. Beneficiaries and target groups. The project will primarily target 36,000
smallholder farmer households (approximately 324,000 people, with special attention
given to women and youth) located in the Arghandab River sub-basin. The project will
support the formation of farmer organizations and WUAs as community institutions.
20. Targeting strategy. The approach adopted by this project is to reach as many poor
people as possible, as efficiently as possible. AIWRDP focuses on the province of
Kandahar to reach the optimum poverty headcount. Afghanistan is the poorest
country in the Asia and the Pacific region, with a 54.5 per cent poverty rate.8 A recent
study9 shows that around 60 per cent of the rural population is living below the
poverty line. In addition, AsDB feasibility studies confirm that 80 per cent of the
population owns less than one hectare of irrigated land, being classified as
smallholder farmers and IFAD target groups.
21. The majority of the targeted beneficiaries can be categorized as moderately poor and
extremely poor households. The proposed project takes due consideration of all of
IFAD’s mainstreaming commitments, with particularly strong attention to gender-,
youth- and climate-focused interventions.
22.
IFAD has worked with the AsDB to establish a gender action plan aimed at ensuring
that women have secure equal access to the development opportunities created under
the project, in spite of severe cultural constraints. Women will also be trained to be
local resource persons (paraprofessionals), particularly for greater outreach to women
farmers and to promote their uptake of best practices and technologies. The project
will also promote and encourage opportunities for youth, specifically through the
creation of employment generation in on-farm and off-farm activities. Women farmers
and youth will have equitable access to agricultural extension services, training
opportunities, technology transfer and advisory services.
B. Components, outcomes and activities
23. The project will have the following components: (i) Dahla Dam capacity increased
(not financed by IFAD resources); (ii) reliability of irrigation water supply increased;
(iii) agricultural water productivity improved; and (iv) capacity in water resource
management and use strengthened.
24. Component 1: Dahla Dam capacity increased. This component will focus on
construction-related works to increase water storage capacity from 288 to 782 million

cubic metres. This infrastructure upgrade will improve the main source of water in the
sub-basin and reduce flood risks to downstream areas.
25. Component 2: Reliability of irrigation water supply increased. The reliable
supply of irrigation water will be increased through irrigation infrastructure
improvement, including by upgrading canals and structures, and introducing
monitoring and control systems on the AIS and community-managed systems.
(i) Modernization of the AIS infrastructure. The project will implement
modernization of 120 preselected irrigation schemes in the Arghandab
sub-basin.
(ii)
Improvement of community irrigation services. The project will provide
support for village communities, including women and youth, for improvement
of community irrigation infrastructure through community contracting.
26. Component 3: Agricultural water productivity improved. This component
comprises the demonstration of innovative on-farm agricultural practices and
investment options, including support for agricultural extension services, conducting
on-farm demonstrations, providing training and advisory services to farmers, and a
matching grant scheme to facilitate investment in technologies to improve water
productivity. The capacity of farmers will be strengthened to improve farm
management and adopt climate-smart irrigation and agricultural technologies and
practices, to improve production and sustainability.
27. Component 4: Capacity in water resource management and use
strengthened. Key activities under this component: (i) water governance;
(ii) strategic water resource management training; and (iii) the National Hydrological
Modelling Platform. The project will support the development of policy, legislation and
regulatory options for water entitlements and allocation systems, so as to allow
improved management of water resources and multi-purpose dams, as well as the
development of regulations and business structures to charge fees for water delivery
services.
C. Theory of change
28. The situation today is such that the farm incomes of smallholder farmers are low,
primarily due to unreliable irrigation water, disincentives for farming investment, low
productivity and an inability of agricultural value chains to generate employment and
thus impact on households’ food security and poverty status. The related core
problem to be addressed is the inefficient management of water resources, poor
irrigation infrastructure, low uptake of improved technology and farming practices
(agriculture and livestock), and fragmented value chains – with the majority of
farmers not linked to markets. Some of the contributing “causes” are the lack of
resilience to climate change, lack of knowledge and capacity, and undeveloped
infrastructure.
29. The proposed project design is strongly evidence-based, and provides a “best
possible” approach to meeting the challenges faced by farmers under the present
regime of water deficit and limited capacity for effective irrigation management. It is
envisaged that the project will create the necessary conditions for production, while
the off-farm activities will impact on-farm actions, as they address the needs for
better access to finance and better communication from market to farm, and will
encourage diversification of farming systems. Structural impacts will enhance farmers’
bargaining power and their ability to benefit from scale in marketing, adding value
and building partnerships between farmer groups and the private sector. The project
will also contribute to improving food and nutrition security in the target areas.
D. Alignment, ownership, and partnerships
30. Alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The project aims
to assist the Government to make progress on the SDGs that fall within IFAD’s
comparative advantages. In particular, it will tackle SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero

hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 8 (decent
work and economic growth), SDG 13 (climate action) and – in part – SDG 17
(partnerships).
31. Alignment with national policy. The project is guided by the government policy for
productive water resources, as outlined in the Strategic Policy Framework for the
Water Sector. It is also in line with the National Water and Natural Resources
Development Programme, which targets: improved access to irrigation for
300,000 ha; establishing and strengthening sub-basin agencies, sub-basin councils,
river basin agencies, river basin councils and WUAs; and restoring 28,000 ha of
rangeland through community-based management.
32. Alignment with IFAD policy. The project rationale is anchored in IFAD’s mandate of
investing in rural people and enabling inclusive and sustainable transformation of
rural areas. The project is also responsive to the three strategic objectives outlined in
IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, and to the specific objectives as identified in
the current Afghanistan country strategy note.
33. Harmonization and partnerships. The project will synergize its efforts with
different entities managing the overall Arghandab Integrated Water Resources
Investment Programme, including the AsDB, the World Bank and the private sector.
In the context of this particular project, partnerships will be explored with: (i) the
private sector, for leveraging investment through matching grants; (ii) research and
private sector agribusinesses; (iii) relevant organizations, including the Arghandab
Sub-Basin Agency; and (iv) project implementation agencies.
E. Costs, benefits and financing
34. The following IFAD-financed project subcomponents are partially counted as climate
finance: 2.2 improvement of community irrigation services; 3.1 demonstration of
innovative agricultural on-farm practices and investment options; and 4.1 water
governance. In line with the Multilateral Development Bank Methodologies for
Tracking Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Finance, the total amount of IFAD climate
finance for this project is calculated on a preliminary basis as US$36.26 million.
Project costs
35. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$395.93 million, including physical and
price contingencies. The total base costs are estimated at US$338.87 million, with
physical and price contingencies accounting for US$28.67 million and US$12.17
million respectively. An amount of US$16.22 million is allocated for security purposes.

Project financing and cofinancing strategy and plan
IFAD and the AsDB will finance the project on a complementary activities basis,
building on each other’s respective comparative advantages. An IFAD Debt
Sustainability Framework (DSF) grant will provide financing of US$40 million, while
AsDB will contribute a grant in the amount of US$348.78 million. The Government’s
and beneficiaries’ contributions are accounted as US$4.26 million and US$2.89 million
respectively.
IFAD grant financing specifically contributes to the above component 2 (IFAD
financing of US$25.53 million), component 3 (IFAD financing of US$7.53 million) and
component 4 (IFAD financing of US$1.36 million), while the remaining US$5.58
million is allocated for physical and price contingencies.
Disbursement
38. AsDB will administer the IFAD grant funds. AsDB and IFAD funds will be disbursed in
accordance with AsDB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The borrower/recipient will
submit a withdrawal application to AsDB, which will be processed and then sent to
IFAD for disbursement directly to the borrower/recipient. AsDB and IFAD will finance
separate expenditure items.
39. Flow of funds. United States dollar advance accounts will be established, one for
each implementing agency (including in the Ministry of Energy and Water, the
Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, and the Ministry of Rural
Rehabilitation and Development), which are to be used exclusively for the AsDB’s and
IFAD’s share of eligible expenditures respectively. The advance accounts will be
managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with the AsDB’s Loan
Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the
borrower/recipient and the AsDB.
40. Disbursement procedures. The Ministry of Energy and Water, the Ministry of

for initial and additional advances to the accounts should be accompanied by an
estimate-of-expenditure sheet setting out the estimated expenditures to be financed
for the forthcoming six months.
Summary of benefits and economic analysis
41. The cost/benefit analysis covers all facilities from upstream to downstream
investments as a package. Hence, direct investment components as well as parallel
financing components (hydropower and urban water supply) were included in the
economic analysis.
42. Beneficiaries from this project include: 11,697 farmers for irrigation and agriculture
development and the Kandahar city population of 1.29 million up to year 2033; an
additional population of 0.20 million for the 48 Arghandab Valley rural communities
along the route of the transmission main for urban and industrial water supply, up to
2035; and up to 447,029 households in Afghanistan’s south-east power system and
the north-east power system, excluding areas north of Kabul, in alleviating load
shedding.
43. Economic indicators. The overall AIWRDP economic analysis – including raising the
Dahla Dam, irrigation and agriculture development, improving water supply for
Kandahar city and Arghandab villages, and Dahla Dam hydroelectric power
development – shows that, with a hurdle rate of 9 per cent, the project is
economically viable with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 15.7 per cent in
constant 2018 prices.
44. Sensitivity analysis. An increase of 10 per cent in capital cost for all components
reduces the EIRR to 14.5 per cent. A scenario of a one-year delay in benefits for all
components – due to construction interruptions arising from resettlement, security,
contractual issues or disputes, or unforeseen conditions encountered on the ground –
reduces the EIRR to 14.7 per cent. These impacts, taken together, do not reduce the
EIRR to below the threshold rate of 9 per cent, thus indicating the robust nature of
the investment.
Exit strategy and sustainability
45. All project activities will be undertaken in a manner that leads to sustainable
outcomes, to be institutionalized within the government and community system. The
annual costs for operations and maintenance of the dam and irrigation will be funded
through special-purpose management entities established for water delivery services
and revenue collection. The revenue model will be facilitated by changes to the Water
Law, allowing charges for water delivery services.
46. The operations and maintenance of the community irrigation system will be managed
by the WUAs strengthened under the project. The farmer-owned company and the
resource centres will have had their capacity sufficiently developed to offer services to
farmers in the post-project period.
III. Risks
A. Risks and mitigation measures
47. Risks and measures for their mitigation are included in the risk assessment and risk
management plan that is attached to the project administration manual and design
report. The risks identified are internalized in the design, with mitigation, and will be
monitored during implementation so that additional mitigation measures may be
taken if necessary. The AsDB has applied their fragile and conflict-affected situation
approach to design.
48. Risks associated with the technical issues related to the design and construction of
the hard infrastructure – such as dam safety, lack of security for contractors and field
staff, and conflict over land ownership/water rights – will be mitigated through

B. Environment and social category
49. AIWRDP is classified as category “A”, due to the anticipated irreversible, diverse or
unprecedented impacts, mostly from raising the existing dam’s height. Mitigation
measures are in place to minimize these impacts. The environmental impact
assessment and initial environmental examination prepared include public
consultation, anticipated environmental impacts, required mitigation, monitoring
measures, and roles and responsibilities. Environmental management plans were
prepared, consisting of plans for mitigation, monitoring, reporting and stakeholder
communication.
50. A draft land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared, with initial
estimates of land acquisition and resettlement impacts, specifying an entitlement
matrix for compensation, including options for livelihood rehabilitation. It also outlines
processes and methodologies to be followed during project implementation.
51. Considering that the AsDB will administer the project, AsDB safeguard policies,
procedures and accountability mechanisms would apply. Any complaints/grievances
linked to the project received by the Fund will be directed to the AsDB.
C. Climate risk classification
52. Climate change risk in Afghanistan is considered high. The climate risk vulnerability
assessment conducted prior to project design indicates significant warming across all
regions and a decrease in precipitation, particularly spring rainfall.10 Climate change
predictions indicate increasing frequency of drought, extreme weather events and a
rise in temperature by 4° C to 6° C over the next 50 years.11 Climate adaptation plans
have been developed and adopted within project design.
53. The project focuses on the climate resilience of farming practices in order to increase
its sustainability. Climate change resilience and adaptation measures include the
adoption of new technologies for on-farm water management, the efficient use of
water and the promotion of climate-smart agricultural practices.

D. Debt sustainability
54. Afghanistan’s GDP growth for 2017 reached 2.7 per cent, driven mostly by the
services sector, which expanded by 2.5 per cent in the context of improving
confidence and investment.12 Economic growth is constrained by violence and
unfavourable weather conditions, and is expected to slow down in 2019 due to the
political uncertainty surrounding the presidential elections held in September 2019.
55.
In spite of Afghanistan’s low debt levels, the most recent International Monetary
Fund/International Development Association DSF report indicates that the country’s
external debt sustainability continues to be at high risk of debt distress. Any change
in the structure of donor financing from grants to concessional lending would lead to
unsustainable debt levels, and would require the implementation of structural reforms
to enhance revenue collection and fiscal oversight. Therefore, it is recommended that
the country’s financing needs be met with donor grants and highly concessional
external borrowing (a minimum 60 per cent grant element).
IV. Implementation
A. Organizational framework
Project management and coordination
56. The Ministry of Finance will be the lead project agency, while the Ministry of Energy
and Water, the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock and the Ministry of
Rural Rehabilitation and Development will be the implementing agencies, supported
by a central programme management office (CPMO) for each. Project implementation
units reporting to the CPMOs will be established in Kandahar. A project steering
committee, chaired by the Ministry of Finance, will be established to provide a formal
coordinating structure.
(i)
The Ministry of Energy and Water will be responsible for overseeing
implementation of the Dahla Dam capacity increase, its operations plan and
capacity development, modernization of the AIS and strengthening of capacity
in water resource management. This ministry will also be responsible for
implementing all environmental and social safeguards, resettlement and
establishment of the overall project performance monitoring system (PPMS).
(ii)
The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock will be responsible for
implementation of agricultural water productivity improvement.
(iii) The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development will be responsible
for implementation of road realignment works, and support to community
development councils for improvement of community irrigation services.
Financial management, procurement and governance
57. Financial management. The implementing agencies have significant experience in
implementation of projects financed by the AsDB and IFAD. The existing financial
management arrangements in place with projects funded by them are appropriate for
AIWRDP.
58. Separate books and records will be maintained by funding source for each
implementing agency, for all expenditures incurred on the project. Project accounts
will be kept following International Public Sector Accounting Standards for cash-based
accounting. The executing agency will prepare a set of detailed project financial
statements to be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the AsDB.
Compliance with financial reporting and auditing requirements will be monitored by
supervision missions, and followed up regularly with all concerned, including with the
external auditor.

59. Procurement. The AsDB Procurement Policy and regulations will apply. The Project
will develop an 18-month procurement plan indicating a threshold, review procedures
and contract packages that are acceptable to the AsDB.
60. All advance contracting and retroactive financing will be undertaken in conformity
with the AsDB Procurement Policy and regulations. The issuance of invitations to bid
under advance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to AsDB approval.
61. Governance. Ensuring good governance is the borrower/recipient’s primary
responsibility. AsDB reserves the right to investigate any violations of its
anticorruption policy, directly or through its agents. All contracts will include
provisions specifying the right of the AsDB to audit and examine the records and
accounts of the executing agency and of all project service providers.
B. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge
management and communications
62. The two principal instruments for planning and monitoring are the project design and
monitoring framework and the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B).
63. Planning. Draft AWP/Bs will be prepared by all implementing agencies and then be
compiled at national level. The proposed overall AWP/B will be submitted to the AsDB
and the national project steering committee for approval.
64. Monitoring and evaluation. Each implementing agency will develop a PPMS, and
update it and report to the AsDB every six months. The PPMS should include all
aspects and information related to the project scope, as stated in the design and
monitoring framework, as well as the agreed additional key indicators.
65. Compliance with the financing agreement covenants will be monitored through
periodic missions, annual progress reports, random checks of documents, and review
of the project’s annual audited financial statements. In addition, each CPMO is
required to submit semi-annual environmental monitoring reports and annual
safeguards monitoring reports, and disclose relevant information to affected persons
promptly upon submission. Meanwhile, monitoring and reporting of the
implementation of safeguard requirements specified in the resettlement plans will be
undertaken semi-annually.
66. Knowledge management. Knowledge management will contribute in documenting
and disseminating best practices from project implementation. Lessons learned will be
analysed and captured as knowledge products to inform policymaking and create
opportunities for scaling up and replicability. Participatory irrigation management,
community contracting and inclusive agricultural value chain development are some
of the focus areas for knowledge management.
67. Strategic communication. AIWRDP is not simply a technical intervention for dam
upgrading and irrigation rehabilitation, but rather a project aimed at socio-economic
transformation. Within six months of grant effectiveness, the project will develop a
plan for stakeholder communication, consultation and participation that succinctly
outlines the stakeholder outreach and engagement approach for implementation.
Innovation and scaling up
68. AIWRDP provides opportunities to promote some approaches that are innovative in
the country:
(i)
Community participation in management and maintenance of irrigation
infrastructure to promote stronger ownership and improve its sustainability;
(ii) Demonstration of innovative on-farm agricultural practices, extension support
and matching grant scheme, to facilitate investment in technologies to improve
on-farm water productivity; and
(iii) Facilitation of the necessary water policy reform, as well as promotion of cost
recovery for water delivery services.

Project successes will also be disseminated, promoted and replicated beyond the
project area. In addition, the water policy reform will provide a clear regulatory
framework to be implemented across the country.
C.
Implementation plans
Implementation readiness and start-up plans
70. AIWRDP start-up is expected to be undertaken in the first quarter of 2020. To
facilitate a swift start, the project design documents include: (i) a project
administration manual; (ii) a list of active procurement packages; (iii) draft terms of
reference for key consultants; and (iv) a draft matching grant manual that includes
the process for sub-project selection, appraisal and approval.
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans
71. The project will be administered and supervised by the AsDB. It will conduct semi-
annual and midterm review missions to assess the performance and progress of the
project, and review compliance with the grant agreement and project agreement
covenants.
72.
IFAD will ensure the participation of a senior consultant in key missions, including the
start-up and midterm review missions, and if necessary special technical support
during supervision missions.
V. Legal instruments and authority
73. A project financing agreement between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and IFAD
will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.
74. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is empowered under its laws to receive financing
from IFAD.
75.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VI. Recommendation
76.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of the
following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a Debt Sustainability Framework grant
to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in an amount of forty million United
States dollars (US$40,000,000) and upon such terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.
