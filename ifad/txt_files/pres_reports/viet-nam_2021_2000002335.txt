5. 
The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam’s macro-economic development record over the 
past 30 years is remarkable. Economic and political reforms have spurred rapid 
economic growth and development, and transformed Viet Nam from one of the 
world’s poorest nations to a lower-middle-income country. 
Agriculture’s significant contribution to economic growth and rural poverty 
reduction has come at a cost, however. Growth in the farm sector has been heavily 
subsidized by unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. In the Mekong Delta, 
overuse of surface and ground water is leading to water scarcity. Climate change 
effects such as rising sea levels, droughts and increasing air temperatures have 
taken their toll on agriculture as well. 
Viet Nam has made impressive progress in poverty reduction. In the last 30 years, 
more than 40 million people have escaped poverty through rapid economic growth 
that has created more and better jobs. Poverty has become overwhelmingly rural. 
The vast majority of the poor (86 per cent) belong to ethnic minorities (EMs) 
residing in remote and mountainous areas.  
Vulnerability to external shocks is prevalent among households with a strong 
dependence on agricultural and wage and non-wage incomes. They also have 
limited access to water infrastructure, insurance and climate-sensitive agro-
advisory services to mitigate risks. The Mekong Delta Plan (MDP) (2013-2020), the 
Agricultural Transformation Programme (ATP) and Government Resolution 120 on 
economic development in the Mekong Delta are key policy instruments seeking to 
address the growing threats from climate change and the unsustainable use of 
natural resources, especially groundwater. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered large vulnerabilities significantly affecting 
Viet Nam's economic development in 2020-2021. For 2021, national economic 
recovery is uncertain due to new outbreaks of the disease and a slow global 
recovery. Recent government policies focus on recovery by investing in public 
infrastructure, promoting access to finance, enhancing labour productivity and 
expanding the use of digital technology. 
IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
6.  Gender and social inclusion. A large majority of the working poor continue to be 
women. Gender inequality is recognized as one of the key causes of poverty. 
Climate change is raising new challenges in this respect, however. The Climate- 
smart Agricultural Value Chain Development in Ben Tre and Tra Vinh (CSAT) will 
mainstream gender equality and apply direct and indirect targeting strategies to 
reach poor women, especially in EMs. Women will be trained in digital technologies 
in order to reduce their workload, cope with climate change, and adopt flexible 
time management. 
7. 
Youth. Employment is the biggest challenge for youth in Viet Nam. The informal 
sector remains the norm for most young workers and over half of employed youth 
are poorly paid. Skills mismatch also affects close to half of the working young. 
1 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
CSAT aims to create an enabling environment for decent employment and 
entrepreneurship along value chains (VCs).  
8.  Nutrition. Viet Nam still suffers from malnutrition among the under-five age 
group. CSAT is not considered as nutrition-sensitive but its focus on climate-
resilient crops, livestock production and VC development will increase household 
revenues and thus the availability and consumption of nutritious foods. 
9. 
Climate and environment. Viet Nam ranks among the top 10 countries globally 
facing long-term climate risks. The Mekong Delta is considered one of the river 
deltas most vulnerable to climate change, notably in terms of sea level rise, 
droughts, extreme heat, severe storms and flooding, which are all causing 
substantial economic and human losses. CSAT will strengthen the Government’s 
ability to support small-scale rural producers in building anticipatory capacity (to 
plan for and reduce shocks), absorptive capacity (to absorb and cope with hocks 
and stresses) and adaptive capacity.1  
10. 
In line with the Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD11) 
mainstreaming commitments, CSAT has been validated as: 
☒ Inclusive of climate finance; and  
☒ Youth-sensitive.  
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
11.  CSAT responds to the Government’s request to design a follow-up project to the 
recently completed Project for Adaptation to Climate Change in the Mekong Delta 
in Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces (AMD). The Government and IFAD consider AMD 
as a success in terms of piloting participatory socio-economic planning and 
innovative technology transfer to strengthen the capacity of smallholder farmers to 
adapt to climate change. 
12. 
13. 
14. 
IFAD’s strategy in Viet Nam over the past 20 years has remained focused on 
supporting the Government to achieve its key development objective – to lift rural 
populations from subsistence farming to climate-resilient, market-oriented 
agriculture. IFAD has targeted previous operations in Ben Tre and Tra Vinh, two of 
the poorest provinces in the Mekong Delta and home to 60,000 poor and near-poor 
households, including the Khmer EM group. The latter has a disproportionately 
higher poverty rate (25 per cent) than the national average (6 per cent).  
IFAD has an important comparative advantage as an agent of change in the 
agriculture and rural sector. The Fund provides access to rural finance and 
develops last-mile rural infrastructure to support inclusive, remunerative and pro-
poor VCs. The current country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP)  
2019-2025, is focused on smallholder farmers and rural small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) in underserved areas with a concentration of EMs. CSAT is fully 
aligned with the COSOP, directly contributing to its three strategic objectives. 
IFAD’s portfolio in Viet Nam has demonstrated that rural infrastructure generates 
the highest impact when linked with VC capacity-building based on participatory 
and market-oriented planning. This approach mainstreams adaptation to climate 
change, makes financial services available and enhances technical and business 
skills among producers. A critical element is private sector engagement with small-
scale producers through project investments (e.g. infrastructure, enhancing 
producer capacities) that incentivize and de-risk public and private investments. 
Building on AMD, there is therefore a strong rationale to continue these 
investments and scale up the lessons learned from CSAT, focusing on investments 
in climate-smart VCs.  
1 CSAT will measure such progress along an integrated resilience indicator and related scorecard which builds on AMD 
experience and will benefit from other ongoing IFAD work on the subject. 
2 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
15. 
IFAD-funded projects in Viet Nam have also demonstrated that rural women and 
youth can be empowered by supporting their businesses and generating decent 
employment for them within VCs. Lastly, lessons from CSAT will contribute directly 
to the MDP and the larger ATP. It is therefore expected that CSAT will generate a 
lasting impact, both in terms of scale and policy, in the Mekong Delta region. 
B.  Lessons learned 
16. 
IFAD’s Viet Nam portfolio has accumulated a wealth of lessons. The most relevant 
for CSAT focus on: (i) promotion of regional planning and cross-sector coordination 
for the Mekong Delta; (ii) ensuring synergies of VC instruments including value 
chain action plans (VCAPs), the Women’s Development Fund (WDF), public-private-
producer partnerships (4Ps) and climate-smart agriculture (CSA); (iii) private 
sector engagement; (iv) women’s empowerment; (v) holistic approach to climate 
resilience from planning to implementation; and (vi) integration of project 
instruments into government programmes, taking into account the new official 
development assistance policies in Viet Nam.  
II.  Project description 
A.  Objectives, geographical area of intervention and target 
groups 
17.  CSAT’s goal is to achieve sustainable and climate-resilient rural transformation in 
Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces, serving as a model for the Mekong Delta region. 
The project’s development objective is to generate sustainable income 
opportunities and improved rural livelihoods for poor households, women, men, 
youth and EMs in Tra Vinh and Ben Tre Provinces.  
18.  Geographical area. CSAT will be implemented in the above provinces, which are 
highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and have major pockets of rural 
poverty. Local inhabitants, their food production systems and economic well-being 
are facing growing threats from climate change. The location of the key VCs will 
determine CSAT’s specific geographical intervention areas.  
19.  Target groups and beneficiaries. CSAT will directly reach 60,000 smallholder 
farmers’ households (Ben Tre 25,000 and Tra Vinh 35,000) equivalent to some 
210,000 people in around 80 communes in both provinces. To ensure greater 
participation and social inclusion of the project's main target groups, a combination 
of direct targeting and self-targeting methods will be set in place. While project 
activities are of interest to all target groups (self-targeting) in the intervention 
area, the direct targeting methods will ensure the participation and creation of 
activities to reach the most vulnerable groups: women, youth and EMs. 
20.  Targets are set for reaching women (40 per cent, of which 16 per cent are 
household heads), youth (20 per cent, of which 50 per cent are young women) and 
EMs (30 per cent in Tra Vinh). 
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
21.  CSAT has three components: (i) Coordination for sustainable and inclusive rural 
transformation; (ii) inclusive and climate-smart VCs; and (iii) project management. 
22.  Component 1/outcome 1. Coordination for sustainable and inclusive rural 
transformation. This component aims at improving the effectiveness of 
cooperation on the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) at provincial and 
Mekong Delta-regional levels, and stronger integration of climate resilience. The 
integrated SEDP forms the basis for climate-resilient VCAPs, planning, capacity-
building and 4P collaboration.  
 
Subcomponent/output 1.1. Provincial and sectoral plans promote 
innovative anti-poverty gender empowerment and climate-resilient 
VC development. This subcomponent draws on IFAD’s experience of SEDP

EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
 
 
 
support in 11 provinces in the past 10 years, including in Ben Tre and 
Tra Vinh. It will review and update the existing SEDPs (2021-2025) 
incorporating a climate resilience vision to 2050 and an increased VC 
orientation. The revised SEDPs will identify and align government cofinancing 
of CSAT activities in component 2. 
Subcomponent/output 1.2. VCAP for climate-resilient, inclusive, and 
remunerative VC investments. In the first year, an in-depth VCAP process 
will identify pro-poor VCs that can lead to higher incomes, are inclusive of 
women and youth, are resilient and adapted to climate change, and are 
linked to private sector technical support and/or off-takers.  
Subcomponent/output 1.3. Functioning of 4P multi-stakeholder 
platforms in support of priority VCs and MDP. CSAT will support the 
establishment of 4P platforms whose main tasks will be to facilitate 
coordination of VC actors, negotiations of farm gate prices, quality standards, 
trade contracts and product branding, and ensure market transparency. The 
platform will include a conflict resolution/grievance system. The provincial 
entrepreneurs’ associations in each province will lead establishment and 
implementation of the 4P platforms. 
Subcomponents/output 1.4. Enhanced capacity-building for inclusive 
VCs. This subcomponent aims to enhance VC actors’ capacity to support an 
enabling business environment and create incentives to attract investments 
to be implemented in component 2. Building on AMD lessons, CSAT will work 
with proven service providers. Each of these partners will provide their own 
financing to work with CSAT. The curriculum introduced by AMD will be 
expanded to include: marketing support, production and business planning, 
and bankable business proposals for CSA. 
23.  Component 2/outcome 2. Inclusive and climate-smart VCs. The outcomes of 
this component build on component 1, notably VCAPs and converging finance along 
SEDP and 4Ps. Outcomes include: smallholder farmers engage in VCs; they have 
improved access to financial services, water, market infrastructure and extension 
services; and they adopt environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient 
technologies, including efficient water usage. All contribute to create jobs for 
women, youth and EMs. Component 2 outputs are financed from the IFAD loan 
(output 2.1) and public and private sectors sources. 
 
 
 
Subcomponent/output 2.1. Climate-resilient infrastructure for 
sustainable water usage and enhanced access to markets. CSAT 
invests in climate-resilient infrastructure needed for inclusive VC 
development. All planned infrastructure will be vetted using social, 
environmental, climate change and sustainability criteria. These structures 
will enable agriculture and related VC actors to better withstand weather 
variability and adverse climate events. 
Subcomponent/output 2.2. Rural producers and enterprises access 
financial services for VC development. CSAT seeks to leverage linkages 
between formal financial institutions and SMEs and producers. These include 
the AMD-supported funds (WDF, climate change adaptation revolving fund), 
government funds (Farmer Support Fund, Start-up Fund, SME Support Fund), 
and other blended financing (Dutch Fund for Climate and Development 
[DFCD]).  
Subcomponent/output 2.3. Smallholder farmers invest in CSA. The 
output of this subcomponent is that smallholder farmers, women, youth and 
EMs, have access to up-to-date, location-specific CSA technologies and 
practices. The new generation of CSA technologies will promote novel 
elements such as digital technology, food safety and quality standards. The 
4 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
adoption of CSA practices will improve the adaptive capacity of smallholder 
farmers to climate change/variability and allow them to better manage the 
scarce resources (notably water) needed for existing or improved agriculture 
production. 
24.  Component 3. Project management. Project coordination follows the proven 
structure of IFAD-funded projects in Viet Nam, notably the lessons learned from 
AMD. It uses a number of additional functions to respond to new requirements, 
including risk management, policy engagement and facilitating private sector 
linkages and partnerships. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge 
management (KM) are addressed in section IV.B. The Project Implementation 
Manual (PIM) describes the detailed implementation arrangements. 
C.  Theory of Change  
25. 
IFAD-funded projects in Viet Nam have mainstreamed climate adaptation, 
participatory planning and market focus in the SEDP in 11 provinces. Access to 
markets was enhanced for community groups/common interest groups; new jobs 
were created and more than 100 4P contracts were issued. Building on these 
lessons, several aspects are explored to ensure an inclusive rural transformation 
process as envisaged by government policies. All project interventions are 
expected to increase income and reduce vulnerability among target groups. 
Moreover, the provincial planning process will inform regional planning and shape 
the rural transformation process in the Mekong Delta. 
26.  First, CSAT will focus on the VCAP in enhancing capacity to organize and leverage 
resources from private and other public sector sources, including national target 
programmes.  
27.  Second, CSAT will establish critical business development services (BDS) and a 4P 
platform for rural producers and their organizations, as well as for public sector and 
private enterprises to facilitate investments and partnerships. The objective is to 
make agriculture a profitable business adapted to climate change and attractive to 
investments by the private sector and financial institutions.  
28.  Third, CSAT will apply the outputs of the VCAP, 4P platform, BDS and capacity-
building to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure and key VCs which can offer 
target groups better incomes. 
D.  Alignment, ownership and partnerships 
29.  CSAT contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 1 
(No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and SDG 5 (Gender equality), and all three 
strategic objectives of the 2019-2025 COSOP and IFAD’s mainstreaming agenda on 
gender, youth, EMs and climate change resilience. 
30.  CSAT is aligned with government strategic goals in three key development areas: 
(i) enabling market-led rural development, (ii) advancing poor people’s access to 
commodity and labour markets, and (iii) enhancing the rural poor’s capacity to 
adapt to climate change. These are articulated in the 2021-2025 SEDP and the 
2021-2030 Socio-Economic Development Strategy, the Agricultural Recovery 
Project, and the 2016-2020 National Target Programme for Climate Change 
Response and Green Growth, as well as the MDP, ATP and Resolution 120. 
31. 
IFAD maintains cooperation with other development partners, notably the World 
Bank, Asian Development Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) and bilateral agencies, including the Netherlands, the African 
Development Fund and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ). 
IFAD is an active member in the Mekong Delta working group, which advises the 
Government on policy issues related to climate change in the region.  
5 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
Project costs 
32.  CSAT costs are estimated at US$136.4 million over five years. The project is being 
financed by an IFAD loan of US$43 million (32 per cent of project cost). The 
Government will contribute US$11.2 million in cash (8 per cent) and US$6.6 million 
in-kind (5 per cent). Beneficiaries will contribute US$4.59 million in-kind 
(3 per cent). Contributions from financial institutions, including DFCD, will amount 
to 52 per cent of project costs. Additional private sector financing will be available 
for producer groups and investments in SME and VC development.  
33. 
In addition, an IFAD-United Nations Industrial Development Organization VC 
initiative targeting women and youth in Ben Tre, funded by a US$0.5 million grant 
from the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund Multi-Partner 
Trust Fund will support CSAT’s start-up phase by drawing on the first lessons 
learned on inclusive VC development. Other internationally funded projects will 
work with CSAT, such as the European Union-funded Development Smart 
Innovation through Research in Agriculture, implemented by the FAO-CIRAD 
(French agricultural research and cooperation organization) and the Canadian 
Government-funded SME development project in Tra Vinh. 
34.  Climate financing. IFAD climate finance for CSAT is preliminarily calculated at 
US$18.53 million, focused mostly under subcomponent 2.1. 
Financing/cofinancing strategy 
35.  CSAT financing includes a US$43 million IFAD loan on ordinary terms and national 
finance, including from the Government, beneficiaries, banks, WDF, private sector 
enterprises and DFCD. In line with the Government‘s official development 
assistance decree 56, IFAD loan financing can be invested only in public 
infrastructure. All other project activities will be cost-shared by other national and 
international sources of finance. 
36.  Most domestic funding has been confirmed. It is envisaged that CSAT and DFCD 
will enter into a memorandum of understanding outlining a joint investment 
strategy with specific targets. As demonstrated by the economic and financial 
analysis, CSAT will generate substantial benefits even without DFCD funding.

table 5 of the project design report at https://orms.ifad.org/projects/2000002335/design_report. 
** Totals including contingencies. 
Disbursement 
37.  Designated accounts (DAs). Upon entry into force of the two financing 
agreements for Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces, the Government is required to 
open and maintain one DA for each province. The two DAs shall be located at a 
commercial bank in the loan’s denominating currency and administered following 
imprest account arrangements.  
38.  Project accounts (PAs). Each provincial project management unit (PMU) shall 
open and maintain in their respective treasuries the PAs denominated in local 
currency for project operations. PAs shall be replenished as necessary from the 
DAs, at the request of the PMU to the Ministry of Finance and in accordance with 
expenditures incurred under the approved annual workplans and budgets 
(AWP/Bs). 
39.  Start-up costs. The Government may request advance withdrawals of up to 
US$300,000 for each province after the financing agreements enter into force and 
prior to meeting the conditions precedent to withdrawal.  
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
40.  CSAT direct benefits are assessed to be mainly investments in climate-smart 
infrastructure, corresponding to 60,000 households. The economic and financial 
analysis focuses on these beneficiaries in subcomponent 2.1. 
41.  Expected indirect benefits from the other components include: adequate planning 
of infrastructure investments; adequate targeting of beneficiary groups; improved 
capacity on CSA practices; and access to financial services and jobs. These benefits 
accrue to 20,000 households in addition to the above-mentioned 60,000 
households, particularly through job creation, improved capacity on CSA and other 
VC functions, and access to finance. Detailed assumptions on outreach are 
presented in annex IV of the project design report. 
42.  The estimated financial results for CSAT are positive, with a net present value of 
US$52 million. The project’s internal rate of return is assessed at 32.1 per cent. For 
the economic analysis, the sensitivity analysis reveals that CSAT remains positive 
in all scenarios envisaged, including a reduction of project benefits of 25 per cent, 
an increase in project costs of 25 per cent, and a delay in project benefits of two 
years. The analysis uses a discount rate of 7 per cent, which is higher than the 
interest rate on long-term Vietnamese bonds. 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
43.  CSAT’s exit strategy provides for the gradual transfer of its policy products and the 
inclusive and climate VC approach and tools into the ATP. Component 1 will be 
entirely financed and embedded in the provincial government structures. To ensure 
mainstreaming of CSAT outputs, notably the VCAP, the exit strategy outlines roles, 
responsibilities and mechanisms for the continuation of the activities. Under 
component 2, infrastructure supervision and operation and maintenance rest with 
the provincial governments. All irrigation will be managed by water users’ groups 
8 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
to be set up and supported as a precondition for CSAT investments. Rural finance 
services continue with the WDF, the public funds and the participating private 
banks.  
44.  A key condition for sustainability is whether producers can cope with climate 
change. CSAT builds the required institutional backup and links it with the funding 
resources required. Based on AMD experience, CSAT promotes innovations, 
learning and implementation as a continuing mechanism led by Provincial People’s 
Committees (PPCs), Can Tho University and the 4P platform. Technology (including 
digital) and knowledge transfers are sponsored by the private sector to ensure a 
steady flow of high-quality products and gain increased trust from markets and 
end-consumers. 
III.  Risks 
A.  Risks and mitigation measures 
45.  Appendix III presents the integrated project risk matrix (IPRM). The IPRM will be 
updated during project implementation. The following key risks were identified: 
(i) COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the economy are stronger than anticipated, 
public revenues are reduced, and government may not be able to provide sufficient 
funds to the provinces for development programmes such as CSAT; and (ii) climate 
events increase in frequency and intensity and affect CSAT target areas before or 
during early project implementation. 
46.  Risk mitigation measures include: CSAT is fully integrated in the country-wide ATP, 
i.e. a core government programme. CSAT provides demand-driven and 
participatory approaches in line with directives from the highest political level. 
Government protocols have efficiently managed climate disasters in the past. CSAT 
complements disaster risk programmes by fostering resilience ex-ante and 
enabling fast recovery after a climate disaster.

B.  Environment and social category 
47. 
IFAD’s Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures (SECAP) classify 
CSAT’s potential social and environmental impacts as low-to-moderate or 
Category B. Most, if not all, CSAT investments aim to enhance climate resilience 
of people and their productive activities, and improve natural resource 
management. CSAT will support better groundwater management, protect cropland 
from saline water intrusion and open-water resources from pollution. The project 
will promote better land management, organic farming and good agricultural 
practices with a view to growing market demand. The SECAP includes the 
Environmental and Social Management Plan for the entirety of the project and the 
Environmental and Social Management Framework for climate-resilient 
infrastructure investments. 
9 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
C.  Climate risk classification 
48.  The SECAP assessed CSAT’s climate risk as high. The target areas in Ben Tre and 
Tra Vinh have been exposed to extreme climatic events, mainly drought and 
salinization. Saline water intrusion on cropland and groundwater has been 
occurring for more than a decade, affecting livelihoods and the economy of the 
entire Mekong Delta region. In both provinces, which are located at the estuaries of 
the delta, farmers have shifted away from rice to other crops or fish farming. CSAT 
investments, notably in infrastructure, will take place in low-lying coastal zones 
and other areas with a record of extreme weather events. The project will promote 
agricultural activities in marginal and/or highly degraded areas that would mitigate 
vulnerability to climate events. 
D.  Debt sustainability  
49.  Viet Nam’s external debt-to-GDP ratio declined sharply to 45.6 per cent in 2018, 
with a moderate increase foreseen at 47.2 per cent in 2019. Public and publicly 
guaranteed external debt is trending downwards at 24 per cent of GDP, in line with 
the authorities’ switch to domestic financing sources and its limiting of guarantees. 
Under the International Monetary Fund/World Bank approach to debt sustainability 
analysis, Viet Nam’s overall debt has been assessed as sustainable, with significant 
access to international capital markets. 
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Project management and coordination 
50.  The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Planning and Investment provide oversight 
at national level and vis-a-vis IFAD. The Government appoints the PPCs of Ben Tre 
and Tra Vinh, respectively, as Lead Project Implementing Agencies, accountable for 
project execution. The PPCs will establish a project steering committee (PSC) in 
each province, led by the Provincial Committee Chairman or Deputy Chairman. 
PSCs are mandated to lead project implementation and ensure coordination and 
integration with all the national target programmes and donor-funded projects. 
51.  Each PPC will establish a dedicated PMU who will be responsible for day-to-day 
project management.  
Financial management, procurement and governance  
52.  A draft FM manual has been prepared for the Government and IFAD. CSAT will 
identify and customize web-based accounting software before project start-up for 
maintenance of accounting records in accordance with the national accounting 
standards, interim financial reports and project-consolidated financial statements. 
It will establish a control framework integrating periodic internal audits, 
independent external audits, and social safeguards based on IFAD policies. 
53.  The inherent country fiduciary risk is substantial: Transparency International’s 
2020 Corruption Perception Index gave Viet Nam a score of 36, placing it 104th out 
of 180 countries. Despite significant improvements, corruption remains a great 
concern to the Government. However, the overall inherent project FM risk is 
moderate and will be reduced to low after mitigation measures are undertaken 
(appendix III). 
54.  Procurement will be carried out in accordance with Procurement Law No. 
43/2013/QH13, Decree 63/2014/ND-CP and subsequently updated public 
procurement regulations, which are assessed as consistent with the latest IFAD 
procurement guidelines. 
55.  The IFAD Policy on Preventing Fraud and Corruption in its Activities and Operations 
is reflected in the Fund’s legal framework2, which applies to all recipients of IFAD 
2 Project Procurement Guidelines, General Conditions for Agricultural Development Financing, IFAD’s Code of Conduct. 
10 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
financing. Provincial PMUs will ensure that CSAT activities are implemented in full 
transparency.  
Beneficiary engagement and grievance redress3 
56.  CSAT’s participatory planning process constitutes the building block for active 
engagement of target groups and stakeholders in CSAT decision-making. Free, 
prior and informed consent and an EM plan will ensure the presence of a feedback 
mechanism where demands, concerns and risks are voiced and risk-mitigation 
measures developed. CSAT will also engage in proactive public information 
disclosure on project implementation and results to create an enabling 
environment for stakeholder engagement. 
Grievance redress 
57.  The current grievance redress mechanism will be strengthened in line with relevant 
Vietnamese laws and regulations. CSAT grievance mechanisms will be two-tiered. 
Tier 1 will be internal and target the communities concerned and Tier 2 will involve 
third-party/external mediation. CSAT will empower grievance redress committees 
at villages, districts and provincial levels, and upwards to hear representations. At 
the village level, the present grievance mechanisms are chaired by elders and/or 
spiritual/tribal leaders, who are largely accepted by local communities, particularly 
EM groups. 
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communication 
58.  As the key instrument for project planning, the AWP/B will be developed through a 
participatory approach based on formulation of VCAPs, 4P investment plans, and 
climate-smart and market-oriented participatory SEDPs as outlined in the PIM.  
59.  The M&E system is embedded in the project Management Information System 
(MIS) integrating project management, FM, procurement and physical progress, 
allowing reporting in real time. The MIS will be the platform for all co-implementing 
agencies to provide and review progress data for planning, reporting and 
adjustments of the implementation plans. Robust project data will feed KM and 
policy dialogue. Outputs, outcomes, and impact indicators are all causally 
connected as set out in the project logical framework.  
60.  The KM strategy is embedded in the Mekong Hub KM strategy and builds on the 
following key elements: (i) a KM programme in support of learning and replicating 
the project good practices and lessons learned among project stakeholders; and 
(ii) support for a broader programme of KM aimed at informing government 
decision-makers and influencing the scaling up of innovation, and policy 
development.  
61.  CSAT will produce communication materials summarizing success stories and to be 
distributed through conferences, workshops, learning routes, and through radio, 
TVs, e-mails, websites and social media. The project will closely cooperate with 
national coordination offices for national target programmes and the agricultural 
research and development policy research group through on-going IFAD-funded 
grants to scale up CSAT innovations. 
Innovation and scaling up 
62.  The following innovations are expected: (i) application of a landscape development 
approach for rural transformation; (ii) inter-province SEDPs with climate-smart VC 
support coordination mechanism; (iii) climate-smart infrastructure models; 
(iv) efficient water purification for high-productivity and disease-controlled 
aquaculture/shrimp VCs; and (v) ICT-based salinity and water management, pest 
control applications and e-marketing.

C.  Implementation plans 
63. 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
IFAD’s loan is scheduled for Executive Board approval in September 2021. Approval 
by the Government of the two financing agreements and inclusion in the national 
and provincial investment plans and 2021-2025 budget are expected during fourth 
quarter 2021. 
64.  Following CSAT approval, PPCs will proceed to recruit their respective PMUs. The 
latter will prepare a start-up plan detailing activities required for implementation. 
These include the finalization of the draft PIM, opening of the designated and PAs, 
set up of M&E, financial and procurement management, AWP/B, and planned 
procurement as outlined in the project design report.  
Supervision, midterm review (MTR) and completion plans 
65.  The Viet Nam IFAD Country Office (ICO) will carry out regular supervision and 
support missions, in line with IFAD guidelines. The ICO will be supported by the 
regional Financial Management Services Division and Strategy and Knowledge 
Department teams. Predominantly national technical consultants will be recruited 
on a needs basis for focused technical support. A midterm survey and MTR will be 
executed during the third year. All missions will be implemented in close 
partnership with national and local authorities, development partners and other 
relevant institutions. 
66.  The PMU will lead the project completion report (PCR) and be supported by the 
ICO. Similarly, the PCR will be preceded by an end-line survey and be 
complemented by stakeholder consultations. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
67.  Under the same ID project, two financing agreements are finalized between the 
Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and IFAD, respectively, one related to the Ben Tre 
Province and the other related to the Tra Vinh Province, which constitute the 
project’s geographical area; the two above-mentioned financing agreements will 
constitute the legal instruments for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower/recipient.  
68.  Due to COVID-19 restrictions in effect in the country, copies of the respective 
negotiated financing agreements with Ben Tre and Tra Vinh Provinces will be 
submitted at a subsequent Executive Board session. IFAD received the decision on 
the investment policy for CSAT approved by the Prime Minister of the Socialist 
Republic of Viet Nam on 26 November 2021, which enabled technical discussions of 
the financing agreements to be held successfully on 30 November 2021. These will 
be converted into the official negotiations once the final authorizations are obtained 
by the borrower’s representative. The Executive Board is requested to approve the 
project on condition that any important variation to the terms presented to the 
Board that might arise during the final negotiations would be brought to the 
attention of the Board in a future session.  
69.  The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is empowered under its laws to receive financing 
from IFAD. 
70. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
VI.  Recommendation 
71. 
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 
the following resolution:  
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the 
Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in an amount of forty-three million United 
States dollars (US$43,000,000) and upon such terms and conditions as shall 
12 
be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented 
herein.

Market information system are building up in Viet Nam , 
including those supported under CSAT, and they provide 
better information to producers and traders to respond to 
oncoming market fluctuations. In addition, a covid-19 grant

The COVID-19 pandemic impacts stronger than anticipated on 
the economy; public revenues are reduced and Government 
may not be able to provide sufficient funds to the provinces 
for development programmes like CSAT 
Mitigations: 
The Government of Viet Nam has managed well the COVID 
pandemic, as reflected by just 5119 total COVID cases (May 
23 2021), and sustained economic growth. There is high 
commitment from GoV and two provinces. Loan agreement 
signed and enforced by GoV and IFAD to ensure sufficiently 
provided fund for project.

Viet Nam has become a lower middle-income country, 
graduated to from IDA to less concessional IBRD terms in 
2017. GoV has put in place new policies on ODA financing 
(Decree 56/2020) that reflect the new situation. New ODA 
type investments such as IFAD funded projects need to focus 
on infrastructure only. This policy prevents to apply common 
IFAD investments in capacities building of poor people. In 
turn, it makes it difficult to reach IFAD ‘s target groups 
effectively unless non-lending resources can be mobilized. 
Mitigations: 
The project design is fully aligned with Viet Nam’s Agricultural 
Restructuring Plan, the New Rural Development Programme, 
the Resolution 120 and its decisions (324, 825). This enables 
CSAT to mobilise large domestic funds to co-finance capacity 
building and other ‘soft’ investments.

CSAT’s investment in infrastructure may cause negative 
environmental impacts including forest clearance, air 
pollution, over-use of water. 
CSAT’s supports to agricultural value chain development may 
coincide with a greater use of pesticides, herbicides, chemical 
fertiliser and plastics. 
Mitigations: 
CSAT develops Environment and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) which guides the preparation of site-
specific Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) 
and Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) procedures to 
ensure environmental and social assessment and consultation 
are done for the sub-project implementation. This aims to 
mitigate the potential adverse impacts from project 
interventions, or reduce them to an acceptable level. 
CSAT promotes CSA practices, including the use of organic 
fertilisers, pest and weed control, among others. Market 
opportunities exist for expanding organic production of high 
value crops. Extension efforts focus on minimizing potential 
negative impacts arising from agricultural value chain 
development.

In-depth climate risks analysis foresee increasing 
temperature, change in rainfall patterns, and increasing risks 
of sea level rise. Risks for investments in infrastructure and 
crops would be substantial if adaptation measures such as 
CSA were not adopted. 
Mitigations: 
CSAT promotes a number of risk mitigation measures: (i) 
Climate and environmental risks are addressed in SEDP and 
VCAP; (ii) Provincial and sectoral climate change action plans 
8 
Appendix III

sub-projects which will incorporate specific mitigation 
measures to address climate risks from proposed 
interventions.

Mitigations: 
CSAT is fully aligned with key policies: Resolution 120 and 
MDP. Domestic funding amounts to about 30 per cent. 
Intensive consultation process took place. Strong financial 
contribution as national co-finance is about 39 per cent of 
which GoV provides about 10 per cent.

The project activities require coordination and planning, and 
institutions may not have capacities. 
Mitigations: 
(i) Establishment of effective management and coordination 
structures in two provinces is well established; (ii) Ownership 
and lead by provincial governments (PPC); (iv) improvement 
of existing planning and technical instruments rather than 
new one. 
Institutional Capacity for Implementation and

Risk: 
Lack of adequate human and financial resources. Challenges 
in terms of coordination capacities and costs considering the 
size of PMU (22 in each province), the number of partners 
including several financing partners with potential different 
reporting and planning requirements. 
Mitigations: 
Provincial governments and line agencies have committed 
sufficient funds for capacity building. CSAT will seek for 
additional funds such from the NTP-NRD. CSAT’s PIM outlines 
implementation requirements in a step by step approach.

provides overall backstopping in transversal functions such as 
financial management and M&E and along missions. 
The proposed institutional arrangements are based on the 
foundation provided under the previous projects in the two 
provinces (i.e. DBRP,IMPP, AMD). These projects have 
demonstrated a solid track record of delivery of even complex 
tasks across province, district and commune structures. AMD, 
for instance, delivered very successfully on the combined 
IFAD loan and ASAP financing as well as other funding 
leveraged from other government programs. The actual size 
of the PMU is smaller than of AMD and builds on its exit 
strategy, with 22 people in each province without any 
additional district and commune personnel. This will ensure 
that project activities will be properly mainstreamed in the 
provincial government programmes of work. 
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements 
Moderate 
Moderate 
Risk:

Inadequate M&E system for planning and monitoring. 
Mitigations: 
CSAT’s M&E system is embedded in the project management 
information system (MIS). It integrates information on project 
management, financial management, procurement and 
physical progress. It allows reporting in real time and serves 
as a platform for the large number of co-implementing 
agencies.

The organizational structure of the implementing agencies for 
AMD project, closing in Dec. 2020, are proposed to be used 
for the new project CSAT. (Ben Tre) There are five accounting 
staff working at the PMU namely: one Chief Accountant, three 
Accountants (two at district level and one at provincial level) 
and one Asset management and taxation officer cum Cashier, 
with required qualification and experience in managing 
foreign funded project since previous IFAD project. The 
Project deploys one full time accountant in each DPMU and 
part-time accountants with limited qualification and capacity 
have been recruited at commune level (CDB). Project FM staff 
have long-term contracts and are subject to annual 
performance reviews. The proposed organizational structures 
of the implementing agencies are found appropriate to the 
new Project. 
(Tra Vinh) There are five accounting staff working at the PCU 
namely: one Chief Accountant, three Accountants and one 
Cashier, with required qualification and experience in 
managing foreign funded project since previous IFAD project. 
For previous projects, project accountants (part-time) have 
10 
Appendix III

been staff have not been retained long-term (transferred to 
other departments). 
Mitigations: 
- Further FM trainings are required to efficiently manage IFAD 
resources at all levels, for effective and efficient project 
operation support. 
- Functional review with clear division of responsibilities 
should be carried out to ensure allocating appropriate 
workload for FM staff at all levels

The new GOV policy on ODA has curtailed the access to IFAD 
finance and consequently led to slow implementation of 
planned project activities. Due to previous GOV policy 
regarding foreign investment tightening and the COVID-19 
situation, the AMD project implemented in the same province 
further experienced difficulties in fund allocation for 2019 and 
2020 AWP/B. 
However, with the new GoV Decree No. 56/2020/ND-CP on 
management and use of ODA and preferential loans issued on 
May 25, 2020, GoV now aims at broader priorities for ODA 
projects of which could bring positive impacts on existing 
projects as well as possibility of new projects in Viet Nam. 
District/Commune level provides work/budget estimates (in 
Commune/District Socioeconomic Development Plans) to 
provincial level for the preparation of the AWP/B by PMU 
accounting department staff, with input from relevant 
stakeholders and the provincial Department of Planning and 
Investment. The PD provides clearance and shares AWP/B 
with PPC which subsequently shares with MoF and with IFAD 
for issuance of NOL. AWP/Bs have been timely provided by 
previous projects with same Borrower/LPA. 
Mitigations: 
The PCU, after consultations with project stakeholders, shall 
prepare its annual budget, linking all the planned activities to 
the cost categories outlined in Schedule II of the Financing 
Agreement; this exercise will take place in advance of the 
preparation of the national budget, to ensure that the 
required Government funds will be allocated and available on 
time. All financing contributions should be clearly stated in 
the budget to be submitted to internal for approval and to 
IFAD for non –objection. 
The LPA should make reasonable annual budgetary provisions

Immediately after entry into force of the two Financing 
Agreements, the GoV is required to open and maintain two 
Designated Accounts (one for the Loan -BT and another one 
for Loan -TV in a commercial bank(s) denominated in loan 
denominating currency for financing the Project. The 
Designated Accounts will be operated by the Ministry of 
Finance (MoF) and administered following Imprest Account 
arrangements. Advances from this Financing must be 
segregated from other funds for the Project. 
The PMU in BT and TV shall open and maintain in their 
provincial treasuries the Project Accounts denominated in 
VND for Project operations. The Project Accounts shall be 
funded and replenished as necessary from the resources held 
in the Designated Account respectively, upon request of the 
PMU and in accordance with expenditures incurred under 
approved AWP/Bs. 
Viet Nam is already live on ICP and the platform will be used 
for submission of withdrawal applications. A new Management 
Information System (MIS) will be procured and implemented, 
in order to facilitate information flows, ensure appropriate 
approval structures and to improve efficiency for data 
retrieval and dissemination. 
Mitigations: 
The project should start working with the software company 
to initiate the process for implementing a new Management 
Information System (MIS), enabling the customization of an 
automatic review and approval process for the new project 
design.

Finance. As part of internal control procedures, the PMU need 
to provide a formal delegation of authority and clear 
segregation of duties among the project staff. In addition, the 
project’s financial performance will be periodically reviewed. 
There are regular reconciliations of cash conducted, which is 
performed by someone other than the cashier. Annual 
physical verification of project assets will be performed by the 
12 
Appendix III 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
Administrative Department and a logbook of leased vehicles 
will be kept (current practice for existing project). 
Mitigations: 
The Provincial PCU shall make sure proper internal controls 
are defined and described in the project FM manual, as part of 
the PIM. Detailed control activities include a good transaction 
trail, personnel policies and competent project staff, 
segregation of duties, physical protection of assets, and 
timely progress and performance reporting. 
Supervision and monitoring during project implementation 
need to be exercised to ensure that the prescribed guidelines 
and requirements are being followed and complied with. 
fiduciary accountability and implementation efficiency 
Project Accounting and Financial Reporting 
Risk: 
The ANNA accounting software has been adapted. However, 
there is a lack of integration and automation from commune 
level to the provincial level. Thus, all detailed transactions 
have been re-keyed in one by one by the financial team at 
PMU. In addition, there were delays in entering accounting 
transactions into the accounting software as the transactions 
are only input into the systems upon completion once all 
supporting documentations have been collected. Forms and 
reports required by the GoV and IFAD were still manually 
prepared outside the system. Furthermore, there is no 
segregation of duties built into the accounting system. 
Mitigations: 
- Customize accounting software, as part of the 
implementation of a new MIS to enable an integrated 
environment, and to permit computerized consolidation; 
- Set up an automation of system reports and forms as 
required by GoV and IFAD i.e. financial statements and 
withdrawal applications submitted to IFAD

The audit is carried out on the basis of International 
Standards on Auditing. Annual audit reports have been 
submitted on time. The auditors have expressed Unqualified 
Opinion on annual Financial Statements over the project 
implementation of 5 years. 
Mitigations: 
13 
Appendix III 
EB 2021/134/R.40/Rev.1 
The auditor should be appointed before the start of the

Moderate 
Moderate 
Moderate 
The Borrower’s regulatory and institutional capacity and 
practices (including compliance with the laws) are inadequate 
to conduct the procurement in a manner that optimizes value 
for money with integrity and prevents corruption. 
Mitigations: 
IFAD implements a zero tolerance to corruption policy. IFAD 
provides no-objection to the annual project procurement 
plans, prior review of large procurement proposals, and ex-
post procurement checks. IFAD policies demand the use of 
competitive procurement methods for projects. Projects 
should provide consolidated procurement information on the 
provincial procurement website and project website 
(opportunities and awards). Project conducts prior and ex-
post reviews, annual audits to strengthen enforcement of the 
debarment system. 
Accountability and Transparency 
Risk: 
Moderate 
Moderate 
Moderate 
Moderate 
Accountability, transparency and oversight arrangements 
(including the handling of complaints regarding, for example, 
SH/SEA and fraud and corruption) are inadequate to 
safeguard the integrity of project procurement and contract 
execution, leading to the unintended use of funds, 
misprocurement, SH/SEA, and/or execution of project 
procurements outside of the required time, cost and quality 
requirements. 
Mitigations: 
Project requests bidders, contractors/ service providers/ 
suppliers to sign Self Certification Form on anticorruption, 
sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse as a part of 
bids/ proposals and contract documents. Government policies 
promotes e-procurement as a main procurement modality.

The implementing agency does not have sound processes, 
procedures, systems and personnel in place for the 
administration, supervision and management of contracts 
resulting in adverse impacts to the development outcomes of 
the project. 
Mitigations: 
Provincial government should retain high performing AMD 
procurement professionals to support full time and 
intermittently. Project should provide training and periodic 
coaching to project and sub-national project staff. A project 
procurement manual has been prepared in draft and be 
finalized before start-up. It details guidance for different 
procurement methods in compliance with IFAD project 
procurement guidelines. 
Public Procurement Processes

Procurement processes and market structures (methods, 
planning, bidding, contract award and contract management) 
are inefficient and/or anti-competitive, resulting in the misuse 
of project funds or sub-optimal implementation of the project 
and achievement of its objectives. 
Mitigations: 
Carry out coaching, on-the-job trainings and refresher 
trainings on procurement (IFAD project procurement 
guidelines and manual, ICP, NOTUS, e-procurement). PMUs 
monitor and update regularly implementation progress of the 
procurement plan with both planned and actual data. IFAS 
provides close supervision. 
Environment, Social and Climate Impact 
Biodiversity Conservation 
Risk: 
VCAP promotes land use change/transformation that would 
result in further loss/degradation of habitat, forest cover or, 
soils; environmentally sensitive and/or vulnerable to natural 
disaster. 
Mitigations: 
CSAT promotes eco-friendly production/certification (e.g. eco-
shrimp, mangrove clam) that increases the biodiversity of the 
region. Sub-projects, notably public infrastructure 
investments, will avoid environmentally sensitive areas and 
special areas for biodiversity conservation.

(for Tra Vinh only) Risk of social, or economic impacts on the 
non Kinh ethnic group, including threats to or the loss of 
resources of historical or cultural significance. 
Mitigations: 
The approach to the non-Kinh ethnic groups is consistent with 
IFAD’s policy on ethnic minorities. 
Cultural differences will dictate the approach adopted. Local 
languages will be used in all village meeting, planning and 
extension sessions. 
District teams responsible for implementation will reflect 
gender balance, and their members will have command of 
ethnic languages. 
Capacity building tools will be developed in the languages of 
the main ethnic groups and take into consideration cultural 
differences. Special efforts will be made to recruit project 
extension agents speaking ethnic groups languages and in 
mobilizing and mentoring students from the ethnic schools.

Mitigations: 
CSAT documents and communicates to all employers and 
workers within the value chain regarding their working 
conditions and terms of employment. CSAT promotes 
transparent contract arrangement including wages and 
benefits, hours of work, overtime arrangements and overtime 
compensation, and leave for illness, maternity, vacation or 
holiday, that at a minimum comply with national law. This 
includes respecting a collective bargaining agreement with a 
workers’ organization if there is such an agreement. 
On the risk of child labor, CSAT will prevent the use of child 
labor and ensure compliance with the government’s labor 
laws and related international treaty obligations. This has 
been included as one of the mitigation measures under the 
ESMF (see Appendix 3 – ESMP for climate resilient 
infrastructures under the issue on worker and public safety). 
Relatedly, compliance with national laws and ILO standards 
on child labor and labor rights will be closely monitored by the 
PMU. Awareness will be raised on the issue and relevant 
clauses will be included in all contracts with service providers. 
Additionally, we will also include the similar mitigation 
measure in the General ESMP as recommended.
