Recommendation for approval
The  Executive  Board  is  invited  to  approve  the  recommendation  for  the  proposed
financing  to the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan for  the Dairy  Value  Chains Development
Project, as contained in paragraph 48.
Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan
for the Dairy Value Chains Development Project
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
The Republic of Uzbekistan is a land-locked, lower middle-income country (GNI per
capita US$1,880 [2013]). A large share of its total population of 30.7 million (2014)
lives in rural communities (some 60 per cent) and is engaged in agriculture-related
activities. Agriculture provides some 25 per cent of the country’s employment, and
its share of GDP is estimated at 17.6 per cent (2014). Whereas Uzbekistan is
largely self-sufficient in terms of food production and food trade balance, it relies on
imports of certain food products, and the state controls wheat production, to ensure
food security, and cotton as a foreign exchange earner. Cotton and grains are the
main crops in Uzbekistan, while horticultural products, fruits, vegetables and
livestock are important income sources for rural families (livestock constitutes some
40 per cent of gross agricultural output).
2.
3.
4.
Uzbekistan’s Human Development Index rank of 0.661 (2013) places it in the 116th
position (i.e. medium human development). Average life expectancy in the country
increased to 69 years in 2012, approximating the level of developed countries
(World Health Organization). Child and maternal mortality rates have decreased
correspondingly. About 16 per cent of Uzbekistan’s total population is characterized
as poor, based on the government poverty line. Seventy-five per cent of the
country’s poor live in disadvantaged rural communities and regions. This poverty is
associated with the low productivity of agriculture and the high level of informality
of rural labour markets. Lack of access to productive assets, infrastructure, energy,
land and water, and technical and financial services are among the causes of
limited productivity and poverty, which disproportionally affect rural women and
young people.
The Government of Uzbekistan’s main economic growth and poverty reduction
goals are outlined in the Welfare Improvement Strategy 2013-2015 (WIS-II). The
strategy seeks to: increase efficiency of the agriculture sector; reduce levels of
poverty, nationwide and among rural populations; and expand cooperation with
international development institutions. Specific objectives for rural development
include: (i) deepening of structural reforms within the agrarian sector and
diversification of agricultural production; (ii) accelerating the sector’s
modernization; and (iii) promoting development of the food industry, while
increasing processing levels of local agricultural raw materials. Financial support to
small and medium-sized businesses, including dehkan farmers (small, family
producers), is among the priorities of banking-sector development.
The IFAD country programme will: (i) support farmers in moving towards an
improved and sustainable agricultural/livestock production that takes advantage of
existing and emerging markets to increase employment, the asset base and
production incomes; (ii) seek to minimize smallholder production risks through
technology transfer, support to key elements of profitable agriculture/livestock
1
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
value chains and establishment of appropriate, accessible asset-building finance. It
will focus on sectors and geographical areas in which dehkan farms predominate.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities
5.
The livestock sector plays an important role in the economy and society of
Uzbekistan. Most production comes from the 4.7 million small dehkan farms, with
the balance from private commercial and a limited number of cooperative (shirkat)
farms. Dehkan farmers own about 95 per cent of cattle and 83 per cent of goats
and sheep. They account for 95 per cent of the total production of meat, 96 per
cent of milk and 89 per cent of wool. Livestock production contributes substantially
to national food security and as an economic and nutritional safety net for rural
households. It provides regular income and high-quality protein, especially for
women and children.
6.
7.
8.
9.
Dehkan farms sustain the Uzbekistan dairy market (85 per cent of milk sales are
from these small family producers); however, milk production in Uzbekistan
operates well below its potential. Average cow milk yields within dehkan farms
rarely exceed six litres per day, with lactation periods of just seven months.
Concerning the livestock subsector, principal constraints on dekhan farmers
include: (i) the limited access to land; (ii) insufficient access to fresh and conserved
forage, as well as unreliable quality; (iii) limited access to reliable animal health
services; (iv) low genetic merit of much of the national herd; (v) inadequate
sanitary conditions at farm and processor levels; (vi) restricted access to
processors and thus markets; and (vii) lack of access to services, including
technical advisory, finance and business development services. The development of
efficient rural producers and processors and their linkage to existing and emerging
markets are central to addressing these constraints.
Regional experience demonstrates that smallholder dairy farmers can become
market-driven farmers when: (i) their access to land and finance improves;
(ii) adequate training is provided; (iii) milk collection becomes organized; (iv) they
establish linkages to local agroenterprises; and (v) financial incentives are provided
to supply quality milk. Some dehkan farmers may even evolve into processors
themselves, scaling up from cottage/household production through integration into
dehkan groups, while building volumes of milk production (individual and
aggregate) and improving their collective business management and negotiating
skills.
Smallholder market access and financial inclusion require adequate incentives and
policy-related support. Basic interventions that support organized dehkan and
private smallholder farmers and their capacity to produce competitively for the
market include: (i) development of organizational and "farming-as-a-business"
skills; (ii) demand-driven technology development and demonstration; (iii) better-
informed and more available input supply and support services, including veterinary
and production services; and (iv) improved linkages along competitive value chains,
improving margins and market share.
10. The use of larger-scale farms as the nucleus for service provision represents an
entry point. Linking dehkan farmers to existing commercial farms can help them
gain access to: quality feed; cold chains and machinery for animal feed and forage;
knowledge (quality procedures); and basic inputs and services.
11. There is a clear need to improve the milk aggregation function within the dairy
value chains in order to support dairy processing expansion. Partnering with
agroprocessors is thus imperative, and should aim to set quality standards for raw
milk, ensuring quality control and delivery mechanisms, and smooth the seasonality
of supply. Accordingly, establishment of milk collection centres (MCC) will entail
various positive externalities to value chain development, in general, but primarily
and directly to the benefit of smallholder farmers living in the vicinity of
2
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
agroprocessing units. MCCs also constitute a suitable convergence point for diverse
and complementary technical support, advisory interventions and input supply,
including concentrated feed and forage.
12.
In addressing these constraints, the project is fully aligned with the WIS-II specific
objectives for rural development, and with the overall government policy of
deepening structural reforms within the agrarian sector and diversifying agricultural
production.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
13. The project’s principal beneficiary groups consist of: (i) dehkan farmers; (ii) private
farmers producing milk and forage; (iii) local entrepreneurs with small-to-medium
dairy processing units; (iv) provincial dairy-sector input suppliers and service
providers; (v) national scientific and academic institute staff; and (vi) the rural
unemployed, for whom project support is expected to create additional employment
opportunities at farm and processing levels. Particular attention will be given to the
participation of rural women and youth, individually and in groups, as milk
producers and as processing and market entrepreneurs.
14. Based on social, demographic and economic criteria (i.e. livestock population and
yield, existence of emerging processing facilities, geographical location, high
demand for financial services, entrepreneurial potential among IFAD target groups,
etc.) – in addition to the social and economic priorities set by the Government – the
project intervention area will focus on Jizzakh and Kashkadarya Provinces. It will
begin in the three rayons (districts) in each province that have been nominated for
livestock and horticulture production diversification from wheat and cotton,
together with the two rayons surrounding the provincial capitals of Jizzakh and
Karshi respectively, but will subsequently cover the whole of each province.
Although women largely drive the dairy sector in Uzbekistan, they tend to be
invisible, and their participation in the value chains is limited, largely as a result of
traditional gender roles. They are currently most active as intermediaries (milking,
cattle husbandry, milk supply, dairy resellers and market vendors) and
microprocessors. They have less opportunity to access necessary resources, such
as capacity-building initiatives, financial support, modern technologies and
equipment. The Dairy Value Chains Development Project (DVCDP)’s gender strategy
aims to enhance women’s participation in and roles along the dairy value chains by
increasing their access to credit and empowering them, both technically and
entrepreneurially, as owners and managers of farms and processing units. The
strategy is not only to support women in production, but also to move them further
up the value chains by engaging them in processing, management, marketing and
ownership. The DVCDP will also support women’s empowerment at the household
level by improving intrahousehold gender relations through a transformation in
household dynamics.
B. Project development objective
15. The goal of the project is to improve the livelihood of rural women and men in
Uzbekistan. Its development objective is to increase the productivity,
competitiveness and market access of domestic dairy products.
C. Components/outcomes
16. The project will be implemented through two components:
(a) Component 1: Dairy value chain capacity and innovation built. Three
subcomponents are envisaged: (i) dairy value chain stakeholder capacity built
by delivering tailored technical and business management training to dehkan
farmers (particularly women livestock owners and managers), private
commercial farmers, rural input supply and service providers, and dairy
3
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
agroprocessors; (ii) technology innovation tested, supporting the
development of innovative, demand-driven milk production and processing
and food safety technologies through participatory, on-farm/factory applied
research and technology demonstration – delivered by national
academic/research institutions, private companies or NGOs; and (iii) the
Forum for Public/Private Collaboration (FPPC) sustainably operational, which
involves establishment of an iterative process of consultation and permanent
learning and partnership through provincial forums. It will involve men and
women stakeholders in all relevant private and public actors engaged in the
dairy sector in each targeted oblast. Due to the pilot nature of this
subcomponent – that is, developing and testing innovative approaches to
public/private cooperation and mutual learning – it will be financed entirely by
the IFAD grant.
(b) Component 2: Dairy production and processing development financed.
The component will enable participating financial institutions (PFI) to increase
their investment in profitable dairy value chains in the project area under the
following subcomponents: (i) dairy value chain strategic investment plans
prepared; and (ii) dairy value chain investment fund profitably disbursed.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
17. The DVCDP seeks to improve the assets and incomes of dairy value chain
stakeholders, including dehkan and private farmers, dairy processing enterprises,
input suppliers and service providers, and the rural unemployed. It will modernize
dairy production in terms of gains in technical and managerial efficiency and
effectiveness at key points of the dairy value chains: (i) capacity development of
value chain stakeholders, especially women; (ii) innovative technology testing and
development; (iii) creation of sustainable dairy value chain stakeholder forums; and
(iv) technical and financial support to primary producers and small-scale market
services and input supply entities. Project support will be delivered in the context of
a management approach that is targeted, demand-driven and participatory.
Organizational framework
B.
18. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) will be the project
implementing agency. Day-to-day oversight of project management will rest with a
project management office (PMO), operating under the auspices of the MAWR Rural
Restructuring Agency (RRA), a state entity that has extensive experience
implementing the projects of other international development and financial
institutions, and which is also responsible for implementation of and operational
support to the IFAD-financed Horticulture Support Project (HSP). Under similar
arrangements to those of the HSP, overall management oversight will rest with a
project steering committee (PSC) consisting of representatives of key ministries,
regional authorities and other relevant stakeholder organizations.
C.
Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
19. The project’s logical framework constitutes the basis for the overall results-based
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system, which comprises performance monitoring
and impact assessment. The PMO M&E officer will be responsible.
20.
Performance monitoring will concentrate on financial and physical outputs and on
the outcomes of project activities. The PMO will submit semi-annual and annual
progress reports in English to the Government (MAWR and the Ministry of Finance
via the PSC) and to IFAD.
4
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
21.
22.
Impact assessment will be a function of concurrent participatory impact monitoring
(PIM) and evaluation based on quantitative repeater surveys, combined with
interviews to capture qualitative aspects.
Provision has been made for appropriate international and/or national technical
assistance to the PMO – principally the M&E officer and the gender equality and
social inclusion officer – with initial design of the progress reporting and
participatory impact assessment and evaluation systems and follow-up M&E.
23. A set of indicators, including IFAD’s Results and Impact Management System
(RIMS), has been provided in the logical framework (appendix II). Two anchor
indicators will help assess impact: household asset ownership and child
malnutrition. Data sources for these two main indicators will probably include:
(i) the State Committee on Statistics; (ii) the Centre for Economic Research;
(iii) the Ministry of Health; and (iv) the project’s M&E database.
24. The indicators will shape the project’s baseline survey. The objective of the baseline
survey will be to establish benchmarks for time-series comparisons between project
beneficiaries and non-beneficiary "control'' populations. The M&E officer will
subsequently carry out repeat surveys. Survey data will be mutually supplemented
as appropriate through regular exchange with the State Committee on Statistics
and with World Bank-supported Living Standards Measurement Surveys. All M&E
data will be disaggregated by sex and assessed relative to project targeting and
gender checklists.
25.
Progress reports, concurrent participatory impact M&E, participatory, rapid rural
appraisals and the findings of ad hoc special studies will be compiled by the PMO
M&E officer into annual project performance reports. Data sources for the annual
performance reports will include: the project baseline survey; semi-annual physical
and financial progress reports for each component; PFI records and project-related
reports, including borrowers’ ''business plans''; the M&E officer’s qualitative
interviews with and case studies of targeted beneficiaries; and reports by PMO staff
and technical advisors on challenges and project facilitation strategies for their
respective component implementation responsibilities. Annual performance reports
will feed into annual stakeholder review and planning workshops. Feedback from
these will be factored into the project’s annual workplan and budget for the
succeeding year, thus closing a circle of participatory, demand-driven planning and
implementation.
26. With regard to knowledge management, the PMO will be responsible for developing
a communication strategy and subsequently documenting the outcomes of project
activities. Provision has been made in the budget for: media production;
development, printing and dissemination of training materials for dairy
modernization; and creation of a project website. Towards the end of the project,
PMO staff, beneficiary representatives and representatives of PFIs and non-financial
implementing partners (e.g. institutes and universities) will review the incremental
documentation with the aim of updating and expanding formalized technical
extension media and producing a management handbook on milk production and
processing. This will be made available in print and electronic formats,
disseminated among project stakeholders and fed into the publication systems of
organizations, with a view towards development of the dairy industry.
Financial management, procurement and governance
D.
27. An assessment of financial management capacity and risk has been completed in
accordance with the guidelines of IFAD’s Controller’s and Financial Services
Division. Overall, financial management risk is rated high. The latest Transparency
International rating of 1.7 for the country implies a high inherent risk of corruption.
Public administration tends to be centralized. Analytical reports by donor partners
indicate that economic management and governance are characterized by relatively
low transparency, and limited voice and participation of citizens. These are some of
5
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
the impediments to strengthened public accountability and may increase the risk of
rent seeking and corruption.
28. A key strength of the Public Financial Management reform project is the recently
deployed Treasury Single Account for processing all government financial
transactions. Significant weaknesses are, however, reported in public procurement
practices and national audit and oversight arrangements.
29. Ninety-two per cent of project proceeds will support the rural finance investments.
Finance will be channelled to targeted beneficiaries through commercial banks and
PFIs. Thus PFIs are key project parties and have a significant role, in a challenging
fiduciary environment, in ensuring that funds reach the intended beneficiaries and
in obtaining assurance on the end-use of funds. Fiduciary risks may arise related to
the financial sustainability of these PFIs, due to internal or external factors: fraud;
misdirected credit funds to ineligible sub-borrowers under the DVCDP; or
inappropriate use of credit funds by sub-borrowers.
30. Specific measures to mitigate fiduciary risks include customized reporting and
monitoring of funds disbursed through PFIs, the financial health of PFIs, and the
use and reflows of funds advanced to them for onlending. Additionally, risk-based
internal audits will be regularly reviewed under internal control systems, and annual
external audits will be arranged in compliance with the IFAD Guidelines on Project
Audits.
Supervision
E.
31. A supervision plan covering the period until the mid-term review will be agreed at
project start-up. The DVCDP will be supervised directly by IFAD. Supervision will
include risk-based financial management supervision and operational reviews
covering a random sample of project activities, be carried out in PY2 and PY4 by
independent auditors under terms of reference acceptable to IFAD.
IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
32. The total investment and incremental recurrent project costs, including physical and
price contingencies, as detailed in table 1, are estimated at about US$39.4 million.
Physical and price contingencies make up about 1 per cent of the total project
costs. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$21 million or about
56 per cent of the total project costs. Taxes and duties make up approximately
US$ 0.3 million (0.8 per cent). Funds allocated to the project management are
about 3 per cent of the total project costs.

B. Project financing
33. An IFAD loan of US$23.9 million (60.7 per cent of the total project costs) will
finance 57 per cent of the “Dairy value chain capacity and innovation built” outcome
(US$1.75 million), and 60 per cent of the “Dairy production and processing
development financed” outcome (US$21.89 million) and 81 per cent of the “Project
coordination” outcome (US$0.97 million). An IFAD grant of US$0.7 million will
cover the full cost of the FPPC.
34. Beneficiaries will contribute approximately US$7.25 million as cofinancing of the
total rural finance investments (a 20 per cent contribution at least). PFIs will
contribute approximately US$7.25 million of these investments (20 per cent
contribution) as parallel financing to the sector.
35. The Government’s contribution will cover all taxes and duties on all project inputs
that involve funding from the IFAD loan and grant (US$0.3 million).

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
36. The project is expected to reach approximately 12,000 households, with various
complementary activities and investments. This includes an estimated 9,000
dehkan farms that will participate in the more than 30 project-supported MCCs, and
in training and technical advice on animal health, feeding and welfare, and milk
hygiene and handling, and who will be exposed to the DVCDP-disseminated
technology innovations. This number of users/beneficiaries will be reached, in
incremental groups, throughout the project investment cycle (PY6). It is a very
cost-effective, on-demand, and affordable way to address the needs of
smallholders.
37. The main results seen from the financial analysis include: (i) a significant increase
in gross and net returns from each model when compared with the without-project
situation; and (ii) substantial cost-benefit ratios illustrating the financial worth of
the investments. The net present values range from US$3,350 to US$307,254,
while the internal rates of return range from 20 per cent to more than 92 per cent.
D. Sustainability
38. The estimated sustainability of the project’s results is based on:
(i) capacity-building activities having an expected perennial impact on the
formation of social and human capital among the identified target groups. This
includes: farmer-group formation at the mahalla level (neighbourhood or local
community); development of entrepreneurial capacities within the target groups;
and the enhanced operational capacity of private veterinarians, other service
providers, input suppliers and financial service providers. This human and social
capital development represents a tangible outcome and impact of project
investments; (ii) the self-targeting, demand-driven nature of the intervention; and
(iii) anticipated ongoing investment in viable agribusinesses and consolidated dairy
value chains through the facilitation of financial access. Viable, competitive private
enterprises created through the project can be expected to succeed and expand.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
39. A main project implementation risk relates to a potential lack of incentives for the
various value chain actors and beneficiaries to participate in project activities.
Mitigating measures include an in-depth, participatory analysis of
production/business opportunities, inputs, other constraints and actual financial
risks, based on bankable business plans. Mitigation also involves a widespread
informational campaign on the project’s objectives and scope, as well as initial
support to farmer group formation at the mahalla level. Regarding macro and
institutional constraints, these will be addressed during formulation of the
programme of work and through early establishment of the FPPC.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
40. The expected outcomes of the DVCDP are fully in line with the overarching goal of
the IFAD Strategic Framework 2011-2015, as well as with IFAD policies on
targeting, gender mainstreaming, rural finance and climate change, and will be
achieved incorporating full awareness of the new social, environmental and climate
assessment procedures. The project is based on key training, technical assistance,
educational and technological development and dissemination activities and
investments. It will promote a gender-sensitive and enabling implementation
environment through its farming and processing promotion components. IFAD’s
targeting requirements are addressed by enabling rural women, women heads of
household, the rural unemployed and young people to participate in project
activities.
10
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
41. The project is classified as a Category B operation. This rating is the result of the
few identified negative environmental impacts expected from its field activities.
Investments in improved forage production, climate smart agriculture/livestock
production and green agribusiness and finance are expected to result in positive
outcomes. The project seeks to reduce pressure on natural resources by introducing
more environmentally sound natural resource management practices and by
diversifying livelihoods. These developments will also enhance the resilience of rural
households to climate change and reduce their vulnerability to extreme weather
events.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
42. Seeking to avoid duplication of efforts and foster complementarities, while taking
advantage of livestock and business-related best practices and technological
innovation, the overall intervention strategy will be based on: (i) partnership
building with the country’s private, commercial sector and with local research and
development institutions and universities, particularly for expanding technical
assistance services and market channels; (ii) harmonization with other donors and
operators such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
Asian Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, World Bank,
and German Agency for International Cooperation; and (iii) overall adherence to
the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. In practice,
harmonization and sectoral coordination will be provided in the context of the
proposed FPPC to promote national dialogue on public/private partnership. The
project complies with the key elements of WIS-II.
Innovations and scaling up
C.
43. The proposed DVCDP espouses a pilot and field demonstration action research
approach as part of its potentially scalable interventions (i.e. during project
implementation and afterwards). The experiences derived from the implementation
experience/lessons learned under the project will facilitate scaling up/replication of
operations in other parts of Uzbekistan, such as the adjacent region of
Surkhandarya. There is also a major potential for scaling up and synergies in
relation to subsequent donor interventions.
Policy engagement
D.
44. The project focuses on opportunities to improve the livelihoods of rural populations.
In this context, consolidation of an enabling environment for private-sector
development is among the key elements of IFAD’s discussions with the Government
and with principal development partners at the country level. In terms of policy,
this implies: gradual reorientation of export policies from raw materials to products
with high value added for the benefit of smallholder producers; continued economic
liberalization, focusing on strengthening private property and protecting ownership
rights; agriculture and climate change adaptation; and rural financial-sector
development. The operational approach to achieving an impact on policy change is
to lead by example through the investment projects that the Fund supports.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
45. A project financing agreement between the Republic of Uzbekistan and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.
46. The Republic of Uzbekistan is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.
47.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
11
EB 2015/115/R.14/Rev.1
VII. Recommendation
48.
