Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of the Philippines for the Rural Agroenterprise Partnerships
for Inclusive Development and Growth Project, as contained in paragraph 45.
Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of the
Philippines for the Rural Agroenterprise Partnerships for
Inclusive Development and Growth Project
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
Over the past decade, GDP growth in the Philippines has averaged 5.4 per cent per
annum and average per capita incomes have doubled, reaching US$2,900 in 2015.
Supported by sound macroeconomic fundamentals, the Philippines is expected to
remain one of East Asia’s top growth performers in the medium term.
2.
The gains of rapid economic growth and structural transformation are not
proportionally accruing to primary producers or workers, resulting in significant
poverty among these groups. Most new jobs have been generated in the low-paid,
low-skilled retail and transportation sectors. Having grown a modest 1.9 per cent
per annum over the past decade, agriculture comprised 10 per cent of value added
in 2015, while services accounted for 59 per cent and industry for 31 per cent.
3. With 55 per cent of the country’s population living in rural areas and agriculture
employing 30 per cent of the labour force, slow agricultural growth contributes to
continuing poverty in rural areas. The incidence of poverty among the country’s 55
million rural inhabitants is 35 per cent, compared to 13 per cent among the 45
million living in urban areas, and is particularly pronounced in rural areas of the
southern island of Mindanao. Thirty per cent of children under 5 suffer from
stunting; and 15 per cent are deficient in vitamin A.
4.
5.
Vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector continue to threaten the achievement of the
country's long-term structural reform and its ambition for shared prosperity for all.
Instead of rising agricultural productivity paving the way for a vibrant, labour-
intensive manufacturing sector and a highly skilled services sector, agricultural
productivity has remained depressed. Low farmer incomes have contributed to
significant out-migration of youth. The Government estimates that the average age
of the country’s 11 million farmers is 57 years.
Yet growth is visible in agro-based enterprises that have access to investment
capital and that efficiently source sufficient volumes of raw material, apply modern
technologies and comply with recognized product standards in response to market
requirements. Growing markets for speciality, high-value crops offer a new outlook
for diversification and added value in the farming sector, including attractive
employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for rural youth.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
6.
7.
RB-COSOP
Capitalizing on market opportunities for rural poverty reduction requires
investments in associated agricultural value chains. The proposed Rural
Agroenterprise Partnerships for Inclusive Development and Growth Project
(RAPID Growth) will provide critical public goods and services needed for the
development of collaborative frameworks and financing facilities that improve
agricultural performance and reduce rural poverty and malnutrition. Upgrading
value chains entails: linking agroenterprises with smallholders; improving
smallholders’ access to productive capital, knowledge and technology; and
improving agroenterprises’ access to agricultural produce of sufficient quality and
quantity, as well as to investment capital.
The proposed project responds to a key thrust within the Government's poverty-
reduction strategy. Within the Government’s 10-point
socio-economic agenda is the commitment to “promote rural and value chain
development toward increasing agricultural and rural enterprise productivity and
rural tourism”. The recently issued Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022
emphasizes increasing the access of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs), cooperatives and overseas Filipinos to production networks and to
financing. RAPID Growth also matches the Sustainable Development Goals most
relevant to IFAD’s strategic objectives and IFAD’s 2017 country strategic
opportunities programme for the Philippines.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
8.
Target groups. The project will directly target small farmers and
microentrepreneurs engaged within selected commodity value chains. It will
indirectly target unemployed and underemployed rural youth, women and men who
can potentially be employed by participating enterprises. Special focus will be
placed on: (i) women farmers and entrepreneurs; (ii) youth (men and women);
and (iii) indigenous peoples. The project will initially target four of the seven
agricultural value chains prioritized by the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI): cocoa; coffee; processed fruits and nuts; and coconut. These commodities
exhibit strong market growth prospects, potential for job creation and high
participation of poor households, and thus can provide sustained economic benefits
to small farmers and enterprises. Once operational models for upgrading these
value chains are demonstrated, other value chains may be included
(prioritized according to the former selection criteria). In addition, RAPID Growth
will support networks of Negosyo Centres to partner with the Technical Education
and Skills Development Authority and learning organizations in developing the
skills of young entrepreneurs engaged in the target chains.
9.
Project area. RAPID Growth will be implemented in six regions and 20 target
provinces. This area was selected based on: current production and growth
potential in the selected commodity chains; poverty incidence; and operational
efficiency considerations. The project area falls primarily in the southern island of
Mindanao, reflecting Mindanao’s large agriculture potential and high poverty rates.
Through its scaling-up strategy, the project may expand to other provinces once an
effective operating model has been established.
B. Project development objective
10. The project goal is to sustainably increase the incomes of small farmers and
unemployed rural women and men across selected value chains. The development
objective is to provide strategic enabling conditions for the sustained growth of
small and microenterprises in selected agricultural commodity chains with
2
EB 2018/123/R.16/Rev.1
comparative advantages, market demand, growth potential, links to small farmers
and the potential for job creation.
C. Components/outcomes
11. Component 1: value chain development, aims to ensure that producers and
value-chain actors execute collaborative action plans and build commercial
partnerships in selected commodity value chains. The component seeks to benefit
78,000 households through 1,665 cooperatives linked to between 150 and 250
enterprises. It will first promote a favourable governance and institutional
framework to support the development of enterprises with strong linkages to
smallholder farmers. Second, it will provide MSMEs and farmers with access to
customized business development services1 so that they can commercialize their
operations and expand their access to remunerative markets. Third, it will promote
business partnerships between enterprises and farmers, whereby enterprises
provide farmers with market-oriented support services that enable farmers to
deliver expected volumes and quality in a timely manner.
12. To promote healthy diets and leverage higher incomes towards better nutrition
outcomes, RAPID will pursue awareness/education initiatives and nutrition-
sensitive investments It will establish partnerships with agencies active in nutrition
awareness campaigns, including WFP and the Department of Social Welfare and
Development. By creating direct access by targeted farmer groups, particularly
women, to nutritional training and awareness programmes, RAPID Growth will
enable poor rural women and men to make better informed decisions with regard
to household economics and their expenditure on food.
13. Component 2: productive investments, relates to : (i) strategic financing,
improving value-chain stakeholders’ access to adapted and affordable financial
services; and (ii) farm-to-market infrastructure focused on securing farmers’ and
small and microenterprises’ access to markets through the rehabilitation of
farm-to-market access roads. Targets include the extension of credit to 78,000
farming households, 1,250 microenterprises and 190 small and medium
enterprises, and the rehabilitation and maintenance of 140 km of
farm-to-market all-weather roads prioritized in strategic investment plans.
14. Component 3: project management, supports DTI and project partners in
delivering project services. As a result of this component, it is expected that the
project will be completed efficiently, on time, within the agreed budget and to
beneficiaries’ satisfaction. The component will finance the costs of project
management and coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting at the
national, regional and provincial levels. It will also finance the costs of contracted
project staff, honoraria of DTI regular staff assigned to RAPID Growth, equipment,
vehicles and operating costs.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
15. RAPID Growth’s implementation approach will feature: (i) public-private
partnerships; (ii) embedding project management within DTI, and building the
capacity of DTI’s Negosyo Centres to broker and facilitate collaborative
arrangements; (iii) enhancing access of MSMEs to business services and promoting
a pluralistic market for business development services; (iv) supporting
multi-stakeholder value chain investment plans at the provincial level; and
(v) developing industry councils and private sector associations to support
coordination, knowledge management and policy dialogue associated with specific
commodity chains.
1 These include training, technical assistance, consultancy and advisory services, marketing assistance, information,
technology development and transfer, and business linkages promotion.
3
EB 2018/123/R.16/Rev.1
16. With respect to investment financing for rural MSMEs, RAPID Growth will reinforce
the strategies of partner institutions (such as the Land Bank of the Philippines, the
Development Bank of the Philippines, the Small Business Corporation and the
Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation) to expand their reach and services to
smallholders cultivating high-value crops and rural MSMEs. RAPID Growth will
support: innovations in de-risking investments; establishment of liability groups;
and the development of tri-party financing arrangements among farmers,
processors and traders, and financial institutions. It will also extend matching grant
financing to selected investments. In addition, the project will seek to strengthen
the capacities of a diverse range of service providers to meet the financial
requirements of value chain actors and promote innovative non-loan mechanisms
such as value chain financing and equity investment. RAPID Growth will also
support the investment of remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs)
towards productive assets and entrepreneurship.
17. RAPID Growth will also invest in the rehabilitation of farm-to-market roads to
facilitate market access for farmers’ produce. Larger projects such as the World
Bank-financed Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) invest in similar
infrastructure at a much larger scale. RAPID Growth will seek to leverage PRDP
investments, but will also provide for carefully targeted investments that benefit
isolated areas not reached by PRDP or other projects. Through RAPID Growth,
DTI will partner with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG)
to improve local governments’ planning frameworks for road infrastructure in
support of private sector-driven economic development.
B. Organizational framework
18. A project coordination office (PCO) embedded in DTI will coordinate
implementation and support from DTI’s regional and provincial offices. Regional
coordination units within DTI’s regional offices will oversee DTI’s provincial offices
and associated Negosyo Centers, which will be tasked with: (i) identifying MSMEs,
farmers and cooperatives interested in partnering; (ii) facilitating the preparation
and monitoring of strategic investment plans and detailed investment plans;
(iii) coordinating the engagement of service providers; and (iv) ensuring provincial
planning and monitoring and evaluation.
19. Regional technical working groups (composed of regional representatives of major
financial services providers along with the National Economic and Development
Authority, Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform, Department
of Environment and Natural Resources, and DTI) will be consulted to secure
multi-agency collaboration, and will approve investment plans and farm-to-market
road projects. DILG will be responsible for providing technical support and
supervision of farm-to-market roads identified and implemented by local
government units.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
20. The project will establish a learning and knowledge-sharing system that provides
analytical information to DTI, implementing partners, investment financing
facilities, government oversight agencies and value chain actors. The system will
ensure that: (i) the project is delivered in accordance with plans and in a timely
manner; (ii) partners have the information they need for adaptive management;
(iii) evidence informs industry councils and public policy-making bodies; and(iv)
public and private entities can learn from implementation to scale up their
investments. The project will monitor the participation of and outcomes for youth
and women and seek to improve their access to project services suited to their
specific requirements.

EB 2018/123/R.16/Rev.1
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
21. The financial management risk of the project has been assessed as medium with
the adoption of the mitigation measures described in the following paragraphs.
22.
Project financial management will be mainstreamed with government systems and
supplemental information will be provided as required to meet IFAD’s guidelines.
The financial management service at DTI’s central office will be responsible for
implementing an efficient financial management system for the project, assisted by
the administrative, financial and management divisions of regional offices.
Contracted finance personnel will support national- regional- and provincial-level
staff. The financial management service at DILG’s central office will handle financial
management of the loan’s infrastructure component through an agreement with
DTI. Contracted finance personnel will also be hired by DILG to assist counterparts
at the DILG central and regional offices, and coordinate with the local government
units. The project implementation manual will include a section detailing financial
management, administration and procurement procedures for the project.
23. The DTI central office will maintain two designated accounts in United States
dollars for receiving the loan and grant proceeds, as well as two corresponding
project accounts in Philippine pesos (PHP) for daily operations. The DILG central
office will also maintain a designated account in United States dollars to receive
IFAD funds for infrastructure activities, and a project account in Philippine pesos for
daily operations. Regional offices of DTI and DILG, participating local government
units and other implementing partners will maintain separate project accounts
exclusively for project activities. Provincial or municipal government units will
execute the rural infrastructure investments. Financial management and oversight
will be undertaken by DILG, which will also conduct consolidated reporting.
24. The Government’s Electronic New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) will be
utilized for financial reporting of project expenditures. Funds will be allocated for
activities necessary for the rollout and enhancement of e-NGAS to meet IFAD’s
reporting requirements. Consolidation of project annual budgets, and financial
reporting will be undertaken by DTI’s central office, which will also coordinate audit
processes. Both DTI and DILG prepare financial statements in accordance with the
Philippine Public Sector Accounting Standards, which are aligned with the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards.
25. The project’s financial statements and records will be audited annually by the
Commission on Audit in accordance with IFAD guidelines. Since 2013, the
Commission has aligned the Philippine Public Sector Standards on Auditing to the
International Standards on Auditing and the International Standards of Supreme
Audit Institutions.
26. The internal audit services of DTI and DILG will include the project in their yearly
work plans.
27. The project will follow government procurement regulations (Republic Act
No. 9184) using the latest implementing rules and regulations to the extent that
they are consistent with IFAD’s Project Procurement Guidelines. IFAD will apply a
zero-tolerance policy to fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions.
E. Supervision
28.
Following the first start-up workshop in project year 1, IFAD and the National
Economic and Development Authority will conduct joint supervision missions
annually and implementation support missions six to nine months later, depending
on progress. A midterm review will be conducted at the end of project year 3.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
32. RAPID Growth will derive its benefits from: (i) improving small farmers’ access to
markets, technologies and services in the target commodity chains; (ii) developing
business partnerships for MSMEs involving small farmers and agribusinesses;
(iii) improving value chain governance and inclusion to facilitate smallholder
farmers’ participation; and (iv) supporting policies and institutional capacities
required to ensure sustainability through DTI.
33. The undiscounted annual incremental net financial benefits are estimated at
US$373.4 million (PHP 7.5 billion). The financial internal rate of return of the
project is 25 per cent with a net present value of US$562 million. The total
incremental employment generation is estimated at 30,000 person-years. All farm
models generate 29,000 person-years – approximately 40 per cent of them women
– and all microenterprises generate approximately 1,000 person-years. The
economic analysis yields an economic internal rate of return of 51 per cent and an
economic net present value of US$2,431 million over 20 years using a discount
rate of 10 per cent. The cost-benefit ratio with the same discount rate is 1.26. The
sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are robust. For example, the
project would still be viable if all costs increased by 20 per cent or benefits were
20 per cent less.
D. Sustainability
34. The RAPID Growth strategy and activities are driven by the aim that, by the end of
project implementation, sustainable mechanisms will ensure continued access by
farmers and small and microenterprises to financial and non-financial services. The
main features of the project approach that will contribute to this goal are as
follows:
Public-private partnership. While DTI retains overall responsibility for
implementation, private-sector actors will provide business development and
financial services to target groups – securing greater volumes and better
quality of produce, and therefore increased returns. This provides strong
incentives for continued service provision beyond project completion.
7

EB 2018/123/R.16/Rev.1
Local resources. The use of local resources to develop entrepreneurship,
expand the range of business development service providers and generate
jobs will strengthen local enterprises and empower farmer organizations.
Capacity building. Capacity building will ensure that stakeholders have the
right mix of competencies to carry activities forward beyond project
completion. Capacity-building programmes will feature periodic capacity
assessment to ensure high performance.
Innovative business models and knowledge management. The project
will develop innovative business models that will be documented and
disseminated through industry councils at the provincial, regional and
national levels. This will build a strong knowledge base for sustaining project
achievements and provide the foundation for scaling up the most successful
and commercially viable mechanisms.
E. Risk identification and mitigation

V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
36. RAPID Growth is fully aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025 in
pursuit of its mutually reinforcing strategic objectives. In particular, it will promote
investment in productive capacities and encourage better and deeper market
participation (and benefits), as well as improved agricultural productivity. IFAD’s
principles of engagement (targeting, empowerment, gender equality, innovation,
learning and scaling up, and partnerships) are fully embedded in the project, its
institutional strengthening approach and operating modalities. RAPID Growth
adheres to IFAD policies and strategies regarding: partnerships; rural finance;
targeting and gender mainstreaming; environment and natural resource
management; climate change and social, environmental and climate assessment
procedures; and scaling up. The environmental and social risk is rated B while the
climate risk for the Philippines is deemed high.

4.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
38. The project objective is fully aligned with the Government’s Philippine Development
Plan 2017-2022 and the priorities in the Government’s socio-economic agenda. The
project will complement other donors working in the same sector – such as the
World Bank – to maximize project impacts on poverty reduction and influence
policy dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders. IFAD will also work
with government programmes for an improved policy environment and
governance. The project will explore diverse types of partnership arrangements
between project beneficiaries and the private sector, building an enabling
environment and delivery systems in support of competitive, inclusive and resilient
agri-food value chains.
Innovations and scaling up
C.
39. Scaling up of innovations is at the centre of IFAD’s country strategy and RAPID
Growth foresees innovations that can be replicated beyond the specific value chains
served by the project. The project seeks to provide optimal models and delivery
systems for competitive, inclusive and resilient agri-food chains. These include:
(i) facilities for innovative technical advisory partnerships that link smallholder
farmers to technical advice from processors and buyers; (ii) expansion of risk
mitigation through cost-efficient solutions for agricultural insurance services;
(iii) studies and assessments for expanding existing loan guarantees from annual
crops to perennial crops; (iv) support to financial innovations such as
micro-banking and credit surety funds; (v) collaborating with OFWs; and
(vi) an agroenterprise innovation facility that provides incentives for private equity
investments in rural enterprises.
Policy engagement
D.
40. Emerging experiences from project execution will be key drivers of national policy
engagement. Through component 1, strengthening value chain governance
includes policy and technical dialogue within regional and provincial industry
councils to improve chain-wide coordination and guide public and private
investments; this includes smallholder farmer organizations, the private sector and
the Government. Workshops will be informed by policy studies commissioned
through DTI. Furthermore, to improve the standard of evaluations and inform
policymaking with evidence, project evaluations will be carried out through a
9
EB 2018/123/R.16/Rev.1
partnership with the Philippines Institute for Development Studies, an agency of
the National Economic and Development Authority and policy think tank.
41.
Policy dialogue will also take place through the Knowledge and Learning Market for
Policy Engagement event organized annually in the Philippines by IFAD and the
Government. RAPID Growth will establish linkages with IFAD regional grants
focusing on policy issues such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations food
market integration grant, implemented by the International Food Policy Research
Institute, which focuses on policy assessments, and the support to farmers through
agro-advisory services grant implemented by the Southeast Asian Regional Center
for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
42. A project financing agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and IFAD
will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.
43. The Republic of the Philippines is empowered under its laws to receive financing
from IFAD.
44.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
45.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the
Republic of the Philippines in an amount equivalent to sixty two million nine
