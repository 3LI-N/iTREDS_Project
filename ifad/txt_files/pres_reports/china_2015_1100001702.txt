Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the People’s Republic of China for the Qinghai Liupan Mountain Area
Poverty Reduction Project, as contained in paragraph 42.
Proposed loan and grant to the People’s Republic of
China for the Qinghai Liupan Mountain Area Poverty
Reduction Project
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country, rural development and poverty context
1.
Economic context. Since opening up to foreign trade and investment and
implementing market reforms in 1979, China has been among the world’s fastest-
growing economies, with real annual GDP growth averaging nearly 10 per cent
through 2013.
2.
Poverty context. China is the first developing country to achieve the United
Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing the number of people
living in extreme poverty and hunger by half. China is widely recognized for its
outstanding achievements in reducing poverty since the reform of the rural
economy. Broad participation in the subsequent reform-driven economic growth,
together with well-funded national poverty reduction programmes, has brought
about a tremendous reduction in rural poverty during the past 30 years.
3. While impressive progress has been made in poverty reduction, China still faces an
uphill task. Pockets of extreme poverty persist in rural areas. An increasing share
of the remaining rural poor are now concentrated in the western provinces/regions,
reflecting the regional economic disparities. The Government is pursuing a
development-oriented poverty reduction strategy, focused on improving
infrastructure, promoting ecologically sound agricultural development,
strengthening marketing and financial services for the poor, encouraging private
entrepreneurs and farmer organizations, and developing off-farm economic
activities including through migration.
4.
Key government priorities in the agriculture and rural sector. At the second
session of the Twelfth National People’s Congress on 5 March 2014, the Premier of
the State Council of the People’s Republic of China presented the major tasks for
2014 in the agricultural and rural sector as follows: (i) make agriculture, rural
areas, and farmers the number one priority and accelerate agricultural
modernization in order to ensure China's food security and increase farmers'
incomes; (ii) strengthen policies for supporting and protecting agriculture;
(iii) strengthen the foundation of agricultural and rural development; (iv) push
forward rural reform; and (v) explore new ways to alleviate poverty through
development and move faster to promote development of contiguous poor areas
and reduce poverty.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
5.
RB-COSOP
Rationale for investing in the Liupan mountain area, Qinghai. The Liupan
mountain area in the eastern part of Qinghai Province is a transition area between
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Loess Plateau and one of the priority focus
areas outlined in the China Poverty Reduction Outline 2011-2020. The area is
1
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
6.
7.
characterized by (i) dependency on agriculture and livestock production; (ii) the
presence of a significant percentage of disadvantaged but economically capable
people; and (iii) degraded land resources.
Rationale for supporting the transformation of the current fragmented
farming system into a market-oriented system based on production of
quality products. In spite of the constraints in the project area, local inhabitants
have developed specialized and concentrated crop and livestock farming that is
suitable for the arid and semi-arid climatic and soil conditions, this is referred to as
“featured agriculture”. The opportunities identified in the Government’s agricultural
strategy are to develop locally featured crop and livestock products that show
market potential for economies of scale. These include the market-oriented
production of various types of annual and perennial crops such as vegetables,
medicinal plants, fruits and locally adapted varieties of livestock (landrace
livestock). Agricultural sector activities need to be transformed into business
ventures that can respond adequately to market opportunities. This will require
transforming the current fragmented farming into market-oriented production of
quality goods with economies of scale to enhance the market competitiveness of
products; upgrading on-farm infrastructure and facilities; adopting environmentally
sound farming practices, water-saving technologies, low-carbon energy-efficient
technologies; and addressing constraints in value chains to connect farmers to
markets.
Alignment with the RB-COSOP 2011-2015. This is the last project to be
designed under the current 2011-2015 COSOP, and it reflects the recent trend of
focusing IFAD support on enhancing income opportunities and increasing resilience,
improving access to markets and value chains, and strengthening resilience to
climate change. The proposed project will promote strategic objectives 1, 2 and 3
of the 2011-2015 COSOP, particularly in relation to improved productivity,
increased access to physical assets and to market and financial services for income
generation, and greater resilience to economic and market risks. The project
design will take into account the experience gained from previous and ongoing
IFAD projects in China, particularly the Shiyan Smallholder Agribusiness
Development Project (SSADEP) and Jiangxi Mountainous Areas Agribusiness
Promotion Project (JiMAAPP).
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
8.
Project area. The project area comprises seven counties under the jurisdiction of
two prefecture-level municipalities in the eastern part of Qinghai Province. These
counties are: Huangzhong, Huangyuan, Minhe, Ledu, Huzhu, Hualong and Xunhua:
The project area is a multi-nationality region, including the Han, Hui, Tu, Salar,
Tibetan and Mongolian ethnic groups. Ethnic minorities account for about
31 per cent of the total population in the province and about 47 per cent of the
total population of the project area.
9.
Target groups. The project will target: (i) poor smallholder farmers with potential
for high-value/locally featured products, and (ii) disadvantaged, vulnerable but
economically capable poor people (women, young people, disabled people, ethnic
minorities, etc.). Specific emphasis will be placed on targeting women (an
estimated 60 per cent of all direct beneficiaries will be women) and ethnic
minorities.
10. Estimated beneficiaries. The project has the potential to benefit approximately
128,000 poor and vulnerable rural households (460,000 people) living in 683 poor
villages, within 82 townships of the seven poverty-stricken counties in Qinghai
Province.
2
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
B. Project development objective
11. The overall goal of this project is to contribute to achieving sustainable and
equitable poverty reduction and improving the livelihoods of rural households in
Qinghai Province. The development objective is to sustainably increase the incomes
of poor and vulnerable rural households residing in selected poor areas in Qinghai
Province. This will be achieved by (i) enhancing agriculture and livestock
productivity, focusing on high-value/locally featured products; (ii) enhancing the
opportunities for targeted farmers to access markets by linking them to
strengthened cooperatives and enterprises; (iii) strengthening the capacity of
vulnerable groups to engage in off-farm income-generating activities; and
(iv) improving the provision of ecosystem services through sustainable land
resources management.
C. Components/outcomes
12. The project is organized around four mutually reinforcing components: (i) climate-
resilient infrastructure and integrated land resource management; (ii) market-
oriented agriculture; (iii) off-farm livelihood support; and (iv) project management
and coordination.
(i)
Climate-resilient infrastructure and integrated land resource
management (approximately US$32.9 million; 26 per cent of project total
costs). This component aims at enhancing agricultural productivity and the
resilience of rural poor people to climate change through improved irrigation
systems and sustainable land and water management. It includes two
subcomponents: (a) irrigation infrastructure enhancement, which aims at
improving irrigation systems and enhancing irrigation water use efficiency in
four schemes through combined physical, institutional and technical support,
and (b) integrated land resources management, which aims at restoring
environmental services within the Huang river catchment by implementing a
sustainable approach to natural resource management.
(ii) Market-oriented agriculture (approximately US$73.7 million; 59 per cent
of total project costs). This component aims at increasing the income of
farmers in poor areas by developing market-oriented production of cash
crops, economic tree crops and livestock, and linking farm producers to
relevant farmers’ cooperatives and agricultural small and microenterprises
(ASMEs) to enhance market access. This will be implemented through four
subcomponents: (a) cash crop development to support farmers in developing
crops with high market value; (b) economic tree crop development, to
promote the rural economy and increase farmers’ income through sustainable
development of economic tree crops and nurseries; (c) livestock development
and rural biogas plants, to support farmers in increasing the production of
livestock with good market potential and mitigating the environmental impact
of livestock farming; and (d) market access enhancement, to enhance the
opportunities and capacity of the producers targeted under the other
subcomponents to access end-markets. This will be achieved by (i) developing
sustainable business linkages between producers and cooperatives and ASMEs
and the related value chains; and (ii) strengthening the capacity of selected
cooperatives and ASMEs to access the market, including through increased
access to rural finance.
(iii) Off-farm livelihood support (approximately US$8.2 million; 6 per cent of
project total costs). This component aims to strengthen the capacity of
vulnerable but economically capable groups (i.e. women, ethnic minorities,
disabled people and young people) to engage in off-farm income-generating
activities.
(iv) Project management and coordination (approximately US$10.53 million;
8 per cent of project total costs). This component will support the
3
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
establishment and operation of project management offices (PMOs) at the
province, municipal and county levels.
III. Project implementation
A. Approach
13. The project will adopt a two-pronged strategy to reduce poverty in the project area
and to sustainably increase the incomes of vulnerable poor people and poor
farmers with the potential to produce high-value/locally featured goods through
activities to: (a) enhance and sustain agriculture and livestock productivity,
particularly high-value/locally featured products and create opportunities for
targeted farmers to access the markets by linking them to strengthened
cooperatives; and (b) sustainably enhance opportunities for vulnerable but
economically capable groups to engage in off-farm income-generating initiatives.
Project implementation will create synergies by building linkages between project
activities, particularly the activities within and between the first and second
components to boost the incomes of rural men and women.
14.
Furthermore, environmental considerations will be mainstreamed into project
design by developing a partnership with the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This
will enhance the sustainability of project benefits through activities such as
sustainable land resource management; introduction of good practices and new
technologies, conservation of niche medicinal plants and indigenous economic
trees; and promotion of renewable rural energy.
B. Organizational framework
15. The Bureau of Poverty Alleviation (BPA) of Qinghai Province will be the lead project
implementation agency and will be responsible for the overall project coordination
and supervision. Project lead groups will be established at the province level and
within each project county to provide overall guidance on project implementation.
The Qinghai Provincial Department of Finance will have primary responsibility for
the administration of project resources while the Department of Finance and
Bureaux of Finance (DOF/BOFs) at the provincial and county levels respectively will
be responsible for financial management.
16.
PMOs will be established by the project lead groups at provincial, municipal, and
county levels and located at the BPAs at the respective level. The PMOs will be
responsible for planning, coordinating, monitoring and reporting on project
activities. The provincial PMO will be responsible for coordinating project
implementation across the seven counties. The county PMOs will be responsible for
coordinating project implementation across sectors at county level. Village
implementation groups will be established in the target villages to ensure
appropriate targeting, participatory planning, implementation and monitoring of the
project activities.
17.
Implementation of project activities will be carried out by relevant technical
agencies at county level on the basis of their mandate and technical expertise. The
implementing agencies will include the BPA, Bureau of Water Resources, Bureau of
Agriculture and Livestock, Forestry Bureau, Women’s Federation and Disabled
Persons’ Federation.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
18. Planning. The annual workplans and budgets (AWPBs), reflecting activities and
capital budgets, will be prepared by county PMOs based on draft AWPBs prepared
by implementing agencies. These will then be consolidated by the provincial PMO.
19. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The project will establish an effective and
efficient M&E system encompassing the provincial PMO, county PMOs and village
4
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
implementation groups. The system will operate in line with IFAD’s M&E guidelines.
The M&E officers of the provincial PMO and county PMOs will be responsible for
M&E project implementation and sharing the lessons learned. Monitoring will focus
on the project outputs, and physical and financial progress of activities. Where
applicable, data will be presented disaggregated by gender and household
category.
20. Knowledge management. The project knowledge management strategy will
draw on the experiences of previous and ongoing IFAD projects as well as
introduce other developments. The provincial and county PMOs will be responsible
for capturing and documenting experiences, successful cases and innovations
resulting from project activities and organize semi-annual and/or annual workshops
to disseminate lessons and innovations. Project management staff will actively
participate in regional knowledge networking activities on topics related to the
project. Exchange of experiences with other IFAD-funded projects sharing similar
design features – particularly with SSADeP and JiMAAPP – will be facilitated.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
21. The Qinghai provincial DOF will have primary responsibility for the administration of
project resources. The DOF/BOFs at the provincial and county levels respectively
will be responsible for: (i) opening and management of the project accounts;
(ii) administering project resources including the IFAD loan and grant, GEF funds
and counterpart funds; (iii) review and approval of the financing needs of project
implementation; (iv) overseeing the use of project resources; (v) ensuring effective
flow of funds for project implementation; (vi) providing appropriate financial
management training to the financial officers of PMOs; and (vii) preparing
withdrawal applications and ensuring reimbursement of eligible project
expenditures on a timely basis.
22. Retroactive financing. As an exception to the General Conditions for Agricultural
Development Financing, provision is made for retroactive financing from the loan of
up to EUR 5.5 million for eligible expenditures incurred as from 27 October 2014 up
to the entry into force of the IFAD financing agreement. The retroactive financing
will mainly pre-finance activities in respect of expenditures for: (i) purchase of
essential equipment for PMOs; (ii) establishment of M&E system; (iii) start-up
training and workshops for implementation and management; (iv) exposure visits
for knowledge and experience sharing; (v) field surveys and studies; and
(vi) goods, services and agriculture inputs for seasonally dependent crop
demonstrations. Expenditures for retroactive financing will need to be specified in
the first AWPB.
23. Flow of funds. Three separate designated accounts – denominated in euro for the
loan and United States dollars for the GEF and IFAD grants – will be opened and
maintained by the DOF of Qinghai Province in a bank acceptable to IFAD, through
which all IFAD loan and grant funds and GEF grants will be channelled,
respectively. At the county level, project accounts denominated in yuan renminbi
(RMB) will be opened and maintained by BOFs and county PMOs, respectively, to
receive funds for project implementation. The project accounts will be funded and
replenished as necessary from the resources held in the designated accounts, upon
request of the PMOs and in accordance with expenditures incurred under approved
AWPBs.
24. The loan proceeds will be onlent from the Ministry of Finance to the DOF of Qinghai
Province where the loan proceeds will be further onlent through municipal BOFs
and finally to county BOFs, at the same terms and conditions and without
additional charges. At the county level, the funds will be transferred from BOFs to
PMOs and the latter will forward the funds to relevant implementing agencies in
accordance with expenditures incurred under approved AWPBs. The flow of GEF
5
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
funds will follow the same procedure as the IFAD loan. The proceeds of the IFAD
and GEF financing will not be used to pay taxes.
25. Procurement. Procurement of goods, works and services financed by the project
will be carried out in accordance with the Government Procurement Law of the
People's Republic of China (2002) and its amendments, to the extent that they are
consistent with the provisions of IFAD’s Project Procurement Guidelines and
Handbook (2010) and its amendments. The procurement methods to be applied in
each case will depend on the expenditure and the estimated value of the contract.
The thresholds suggested for different procurement methods, to be applied in
specific cases, will be detailed in the letter to the borrower.
26. Governance. The overall financial risk for the project was rated as medium. The
DOF of Qinghai Province and the provincial PMO will follow a financial management
and accounting system in accordance with internationally recognized accounting
standards to ensure accurate and timely reporting of the use of both the IFAD loan
and grant and the GEF grant. Additional control measures will be put in place to
mitigate possible fiduciary risks, including: (a) harmonization of a financial
management guideline into the project implementation manual, specifying the
budgeting, accounting, internal controls, reporting and auditing arrangements;
(b) appointment of full-time financial management staff in provincial PMO and
project accountants in all county PMOs; (c) installation of accounting software at
the provincial and all county PMOs; and (d) a project-specific annual external audit
undertaken in accordance with International Accounting Standards and IFAD Audit
Guidelines by the National Audit Office, among other control measures. In addition,
according to the national procurement guidelines, the following transparency
principles will be applied: (a) all national competitive bidding procurement
operations will be publicized on the local media and provincial procurement
websites; (b) for local shopping, results will be publicized in local media, and the
information boards of townships and villages. The project’s procurement committee
will be composed of representatives of different entities such as technical agencies,
finance bureaux, and audit and supervisory bodies as well as township and villages
representatives; (c) office equipment and small value items will be procured by
adopting either local shopping or direct purchase methods. Goods will be examined
on receipt and registered for subsequent verification and audit.
E. Supervision
27. The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. In order to facilitate project
implementation and ensure the achievement of project objectives, IFAD and the
Government will perform annual supervision missions, a midterm review and a
completion review.
IV. Project costs, financing, benefits
A. Project costs
28. The total project cost is estimated at US$125.25 million, including contingencies
(US$4.93 million) over a five-year implementation period. Project costs are
organized into four main components: (i) climate-resilient infrastructure and
integrated land management (26 per cent of baseline costs); (ii) market-oriented
agriculture (62 per cent of baseline costs); (iii) off-farm livelihoods support
(6 per cent of baseline costs); and (iv) project management (6 per cent of baseline
costs). Investment and recurrent costs amount to 93.2 per cent and 6.8 per cent of
total project costs, respectively. Recurrent cost implications for the Government
beyond the life of the project are minimal.
B. Project financing
29.
IFAD will contribute approximately US$43.48 million (33.9 per cent of the total
cost) to the project: US$42.48 million as a loan and US$1 million as a grant to
finance selected technical activities and capacity-building inputs to enhance project
6
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
effectiveness and sustainability. The focus will be on areas that have limited
government financing but whose performance directly contributes to the
effectiveness, impact and sustainability of the overall project (i.e. capacity-building
to water users’ associations, capacity-building of farmers for better market linkage
and access, technical support for inclusive rural finance models, and results and
knowledge management for extended impact). The Government of Qinghai
Province will contribute to the project in the amount of US$42.48 million
(34 per cent) in cash and sector matching funds. Through a grant, expected to be
approved during the next GEF cycle in 2018, the GEF will contribute US$7.15
million (5.7 per cent of the project costs). Cooperatives and ASMEs will contribute
in the amount of US$3.45 million (2.8 per cent); participating beneficiaries will
contribute US$13.59 million (10.9 per cent), both in-kind and cash. A contribution
of US$15.09 million (12.1 per cent) will be leveraged from banks and financing
institutions.
30. Cofinancing ratio. The ratio of IFAD contribution to Government counterpart
funds is 1:1 and the ratio of IFAD contribution to total cofinancing is 1:1.9.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
31.
Project benefits have been estimated over a 20-year time frame using a discount
rate of 6 per cent. Current calculations show that the project as a whole yields an
economic rate of return of 24 per cent, a benefit-cost ratio of 1.65 and the net
present value of RMB 1,981 million. A positive net present value under the current
opportunity cost of capital of 6 per cent and even at a 20 per cent discounted rate
indicates that the project investments are robust.
D. Sustainability
32. There are several elements in the project that ensure post-project sustainability of
the supported activities and generated benefits: (i) project activities are designed
in line with the government’s rural development and poverty reduction strategies
and priorities. It is thus foreseeable that the Government will continue supporting
the overall development of the project area after the completion of the project;
(ii) the Government and beneficiaries’ significant contribution to project activities
suggests a high level of commitment and ownership with regard to the project
activities; (iii) institutional sustainability: implementation of the project activities is
carried out by the relevant technical agencies at county level. Those agencies are
permanent governmental institutions, and they are also the primary service
providers for project-related activities in the project area; (iv) technical
1 Final disbursement categories will be decided during negotiations based on IFAD’s procedures, which will include a
maximum of five cost categories for reasons of efficiency.
8
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
sustainability: staff of the technical service agencies at all levels will receive regular
training on updated technology and practices with the support of the project and
other government-funded programmes. Sustainable technical services to the
project beneficiaries will be foreseeable since they are part of the mandate of those
agencies; (v) environmental sustainability: many of the project activities directly
contribute to environmental sustainability.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
33. The project is designed in response to the needs of potential beneficiaries after a
full analysis of the project area in terms of constraints and opportunities for
development. Project activities are aligned with stakeholders’ needs and are
designed in line with the Government’s policy directives and poverty reduction and
rural development strategies. Any risks for the project would therefore arise from a
rapidly changing economic environment. These risks, however, are mitigated to a
large extent by the demand-driven nature and value chain approach of the project,
which will ensure continuous adjustments to address problems encountered during
project implementation.
V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
34. The project is in line with IFAD’s policies, specifically: (i) a specific gender
mainstreaming strategy has been designed in compliance with the IFAD gender
policy; (ii) the project’s poverty focus, particularly the criteria for the selection of
target villages and households, is designed in line with IFAD’s targeting;
(iii) participatory approaches for project planning are designed in line with IFAD’s
anticorruption policy; (iv) the strategy for scaling-up of positive results is designed
in line with IFAD’s scaling-up policy; (v) climate-related risks are analysed and
measures to mitigate potential negative impacts are designed in line with IFAD’s
climate change policy; and (vi) potential negative environmental impacts have
been analysed and measures designed to mitigate such impacts in line with IFAD’s
environmental policy.
B. Alignment and harmonization
35. The project is in line with the government’s development-oriented poverty
reduction strategy, aimed at restructuring the agricultural sector towards
increased production of cash and tree crops and livestock products with potential
for high market value; linking farm producers to markets by building
partnerships with pro-poor farmers’ cooperatives; and adopting environmentally
sound agricultural technologies, as outlined in the China Poverty Reduction Outline
2011-2020.
C.
36.
Innovations and scaling up
Innovations. There are several innovative approaches that the project is expected
to introduce in the project area, including: (i) building linkages between
smallholder farmers and market players/the private sector; (ii) leveraging funds to
facilitate smallholder farmers, cooperatives and ASMEs in obtaining investment
capital; (iii) introducing innovative financing practices on a pilot basis;
(iv) introducing, on a pilot basis, an approach to WUA management that grants
members full ownership by enabling them to collect and directly manage the water
users’ fees; (v) introducing a payment for ecosystem services mechanism on a
pilot basis; and (vi) introducing new technologies to adapt biogas systems to local
conditions, among other innovative approaches. The project design includes a
strategy for capturing, documenting and scaling-up of innovations resulting from
project implementation and management.
37. Scaling-up. Innovative approaches introduced by the project can be easily scaled-
up both within Qinghai Province, and outside. The scaling-up framework includes
9
EB 2015/115/R.11/Rev.1
the following elements: (i) scaling up champions will include the BPA and other
implementing agencies, likeminded cooperatives, ASMEs and beneficiaries;
(ii) external factors catalysing the process include the increasing and unmet
demand for high-value/locally featured crop and livestock products; (iii) local
factors that would catalyse the process include the high levels of poverty, and the
unexploited potential for increasing the flow of local products to the market;
(iv) incentives that would drive the process include economic incentives (i.e. the
desire of farmers to increase their incomes and of cooperatives/ASMEs to increase
their profits); (v) the main pathway to scale up the activities and approaches
introduced by the project is through the development of linkages between the
smallholder farmers and the market (through cooperatives and/or ASMEs); and
(vi) IFAD’s role would be to facilitate, through the provision of financial and
technical resources, the establishment of such linkages.
D. Policy engagement
38. Several approaches to be introduced by the project have the potential to inform
policymaking at both the provincial and the national level. These include:
(i) introducing, on a pilot basis, an approach in the management of the WUAs that
grants members full ownership by enabling them to collect and directly manage the
water users’ fees; (ii) introducing innovative financing practices on a pilot
basis;(iii) introducing a payment for ecosystem services mechanism on a pilot
basis; and (iv) introducing an integrated approach to planning and management of
the Huangshui drainage basin and the implementation of the integrated land
resources management plans.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
39. A project financing agreement between the People’s Republic of China and IFAD
will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.
40. The People’s Republic of China is empowered under its laws to receive financing
from IFAD.
41.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
42.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
