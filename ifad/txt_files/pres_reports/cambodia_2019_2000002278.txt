Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in
paragraph 72.
I. Context
A. National context and rationale for IFAD involvement
1.
2.
3.
4.
National context
Cambodia has made significant progress in recovering from its history of instability,
with two decades of strong economic growth and poverty reduction. The economy
sustained an average growth rate of over 7 per cent between 1995 and 2018,
bringing it up to lower-middle-income status in 2017. Growth has been driven
mainly by manufacturing and services, but agriculture still provides around half of
current employment. Wage income from both local and migratory labour is
increasingly important to rural households. Growth has been accompanied by
poverty reduction, from 47.8 per cent in 2007 to 13.5 per cent by 2014.1
Despite these achievements, Cambodia faces continuing challenges. Around
25 per cent of the population remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty, and
around 35 per cent live in multidimensional poverty.2 Undernutrition is an issue,
with around 32 per cent of children under five being stunted.
Agricultural supply chains are underdeveloped, with high transport costs and low
coverage. Only about 2,000 km out of 45,000 km of rural roads are hard paved.
Special aspects relating to IFAD’s corporate mainstreaming priorities
Cambodia is highly vulnerable to climate change, due to its reliance on rainfed
agriculture and a lack of resources and infrastructure to cope with floods and
droughts. The Sustainable Assets for Agriculture Markets, Business and Trade
(SAAMBAT) Project will adopt climate-proof design standards across all its
infrastructure interventions.
5. Women continue to face disadvantages, earning 30 per cent less than men. All
SAAMBAT interventions will include gender action plans to ensure their contribution
to IFAD’s gender policy objectives. The needs and opportunities facing women will
be considered in infrastructure, skills training, access to digital technologies and
opportunities for women entrepreneurs.
6.
7.
8.
Cambodia’s population is the youngest in South-East Asia, but rural youth lack
employable skills. SAAMBAT is youth-focused, with component 2 committed to
delivering demand-matched vocational skills and enabling young entrepreneurs to
develop and adopt digital technologies for agricultural value chains.
The project management unit (PMU), established within the Ministry of Rural
Development, will also coordinate with the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) to ensure alignment with UNICEF’s nutrition activities in SAAMBAT
provinces.
Rationale for IFAD involvement
SAAMBAT’s design is aligned with the policies and strategies of the Royal
Government of Cambodia and with IFAD’s corporate priorities. The Government's
development strategy is embodied in its “Rectangular Strategy” (currently in phase
IV, referred to as RS-IV) and the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018,
which include rural infrastructure and skills training as priorities. Development of
the digital economy is a major current focus of policymakers. SAAMBAT is also

aligned with the draft agriculture sector masterplan, aimed at growth through
improved infrastructure.
9.
SAAMBAT directly addresses the infrastructure constraints in the rural economy
and the constraints faced by rural youth. The SAAMBAT design builds on IFAD’s
experience and expertise in developing rural value chains and delivering
climate-resilient infrastructure and services to rural communities.
B. Lessons learned
10. SAAMBAT builds upon the lessons learned from IFAD’s partnership with the Royal
Government of Cambodia since 1996. SAAMBAT directly addresses the
recommendations of the country strategy and programme evaluation – to target
commercial and advanced farmers and poorer households, and to balance
investment in human capital (component 2) with tangible items (component 1).
The project design is also based on the request from the Government (coming out
of its experience) for IFAD to balance investments in physical assets with new and
innovative approaches to modernizing the rural economy.
11. The design process has also drawn lessons from previous projects to avoid delays
and enhance implementation readiness: the central project team is already in
place.
II. Project description
A. Project objectives, geographic area of intervention and target
groups
12. The project’s development objective is to “sustainably increase productivity of rural
youth, enterprises and the rural economy”, thus contributing to the goal of reduced
poverty and enhanced food security.3 Low productivity contributes to the increasing
income gap between urban and rural areas, outmigration and the persistence of
multidimensional poverty. SAAMBAT will contribute to the three strategic objectives
(SOs) of the results-based country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP),
both directly and through synergies with the Accelerating Inclusive Markets for
Smallholders (AIMS) project and the Agriculture Services Programme for
Innovation, Resilience and Extension (ASPIRE). SO1 (poor smallholders enabled to
take advantage of market opportunities) will be achieved through improved
physical connectivity to markets and capacity development, SO2 (climate
resilience) through infrastructure facilities that are climate-resilient and SO3
(improve poor households' access to strengthened rural services) through
vocational training for rural youth and digital services.
13. The SAAMBAT design follows a programmatic approach in which components and
target areas are selected for their complementarity with ASPIRE (focusing on
production and agriculture extension) and AIMS (marketing and value chains), and
with the planned interventions of other development partners. In line with the
programmatic approach, SAAMBAT will work nationally and in 50 areas of
smallholder production of commodities targeted by ASPIRE and AIMS (referred to
as economic poles [EPs]), and potentially including any of the 24 rural provinces of
Cambodia. For phase I, 10 EPs have been selected, based on criteria that include:
(i) potential for agricultural growth based on smallholder production; (ii) need for
infrastructure; (iii) poverty and a high level of outward labour migration,
particularly on the part of youth; and (iv) strong commitment and capacity of the
local leadership. Areas of importance to the vegetable value chain have been
prioritized.
14.
Fifteen additional EPs will be selected in project year 1 and project year 2, and a
further 25 at midterm. SAAMBAT will finance hard paved roads in 25 EPs. The

remaining 25 EPs will be in areas where projects financed by partners – including
the KfW Development Bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), the World
Bank and/or the Asian Development Bank – will construct paved roads. In these
EPs, SAAMBAT will finance smaller value chain infrastructure and
non-infrastructure investments.
15. About 227,000 households residing within the EP – approximately 1 million
individuals – will be the direct beneficiaries of SAAMBAT. The primary target groups
of SAAMBAT are: (i) smallholder farmers with the potential to strengthen
market-led production; (ii) unemployed/underemployed youth (below 30 years of
age) from poor rural households who are willing to enhance their skills and seek
formal employment; and (iii) private enterprises and cooperatives. The majority of
direct participants in project activities will be women. Households suffering
multidimensional poverty will be identified through area targeting, which is aligned
with AIMS and ASPIRE. The poverty level – as reflected by the Government's
Identification of Poor Households methodology (also adopted by the United Nations
system and international financial institutions in Cambodia) – is a key criterion in
the selection of the EPs.
B. Components/outcomes and activities
16. The project will have the following components: (i) value chain infrastructure; and
(ii) skills, technology and enterprise.
17. Component 1: Value chain infrastructure. The outcome of this component is
increased benefits for poor rural people as a result of market participation.
Physical outputs will include 450 km of rural roads, around 50 rural market areas
improved and 25 other value chain infrastructure facilities. Water management
schemes and renewable energy technologies will be supported, if suitable
opportunities and funding are identified.
18.
Infrastructure subprojects will be selected on the basis of their ability to stimulate
private investment and growth in value chains supported by AIMS and/or ASPIRE,
particularly the vegetable value chain. Tertiary roads will be paved with bitumen or
concrete in areas prone to flooding. Farm access roads will be gravel-surfaced.
Ferry crossings will improve their landings and access operated by private
operators. Markets and logistics facilities will be operated by user committees. All
infrastructure will be constructed to meet climate-proofed standards.
19. Water for agriculture, which is a key constraint for smallholders, will be addressed
primarily through partnership with the AFD’s Water for Cambodia project.
SAAMBAT will study the feasibility of developing innovative approaches to water
management based in the private sector or agriculture cooperatives. If suitable
opportunities are identified, these activities will be integrated into SAAMBAT from
year 3 onwards.
20. Component 2: Skills, technology and enterprise, with the outcome of poor
rural people’s productive capacities increased, is expected to result in at least
4,500 rural youth being productively employed, 500 small and medium-sized
enterprises developed and 25,000 rural value chain actors using digital technology.
Physical outputs will include skills training for 6,800 rural youth, a rural business
incubator and development of a “Khmer Agriculture Suite” (KAS), comprising an
open digital platform and supporting infrastructure.
21. Subcomponent 2.1: Skills for rural youth. This will assist rural youth to acquire
technical skills or start their own businesses. All training for eligible rural youth will
be in skills required by major employers, and provided in partnership with the
private sector. Youth entering the programme will join an induction course of soft
skills needed for entry into formal employment or training. These youth will be
assigned to a national or local technical skills training course or – through the rural
business incubator – will be connected to training and finance to start businesses.

22. Subcomponent 2.2: Technology and enterprise for agricultural value
chains. This will assist the Government’s Techo Startup Center (TSC) to create
KAS. Three groups of activities will be mutually reinforcing but also capable of
delivering results independently: (i) development of the core KAS platform and key
applications; (ii) a challenge fund to provide incentives for digital innovators to
develop, launch and run applications benefiting smallholder agriculture (plus
climate change adaptation and nutrition); and (iii) an outreach campaign through
which value chain actors will receive digital literacy training.
23. Subcomponent 2.3: Strategic studies, policy research and programme
development. Strategic studies will consist in feasibility and/or pre-design studies
of investments with the potential to benefit smallholders, including one major
feasibility study for regional wholesale markets for the safe vegetable value chain.
Policy research will promote development of the smallholder agriculture sector and
extension of the digital technology ecosystem to the rural economy. Research will
also focus on mainstreaming the themes of the Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD's
Resources of climate change, gender, youth and nutrition within the national policy
framework, and will inform future development of the IFAD country programme.
The subcomponent will also finance activities to strengthen the programmatic
approach.
C. Theory of change
24. SAAMBAT seeks a sustainable reduction in long-term, multidimensional poverty,
vulnerability and food insecurity, through a more productive, resilient, equitable
and diverse rural economy. The climate-resilient infrastructure component will
support and enhance the sustainability of production and marketing efforts of
smallholder farmers. Smallholder production will be more market-directed and will
make increasing use of modern technology. The rural population – especially
women and youth – will receive new technical and soft skills contributing to
enhanced productivity or employment.
25. SAAMBAT will complement AIMS, ASPIRE and partner programmes to address
these constraints in a holistic manner. The integrated programme will reduce
production and marketing costs, increase private sector investment and activity,
and increase the productivity of labour for farmers, small and
medium-sized enterprise owner/operators and employees. In turn, smallholders,
poor households, women and youth will experience increased incomes and
expanded economic opportunities. A strengthened and diversified rural economy
will become more resilient to climate change.
D. Alignment, ownership, and partnerships
26. Cambodia’s national strategy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals is the
“Rectangular Strategy”. Cambodia’s RS-IV priorities directly addressed by
SAAMBAT include: (i) investment in rural roads; (ii) promoting the use of digital
and smart technology in agriculture; and (iii) establishing clean and hygienic
wholesale vegetable markets. SAAMBAT’S programmatic approach will provide
integrated support to national policy priorities and will also finance policy research
activities at the programme level.
27. SAAMBAT has been designed through inclusive dialogue with development
partners, including through the Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water,
which is co-facilitated by IFAD. The programmatic approach will proactively
develop alignments with other bodies. (Memorandums of understanding are being
developed with AFD and KfW Development Bank in the rural infrastructure sector).
In terms of collaboration between the Rome-based agencies (RBAs), the joint
research agenda being developed by the RBAs in Cambodia will be aligned with
SAAMBAT’s policy work. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations will also provide technical assistance under SAAMBAT on good agricultural
practices.

E. Costs, benefits and financing
28. Both components of the project include portions that are counted as climate
finance. The total amount of IFAD climate finance for this project is calculated at
US$38.6 million, or 71 per cent of total IFAD financing (as per the multilateral
development banks' Methodologies for Tracking Climate Adaptation and Mitigation
Finance).
Project costs
29. Total project costs, including price and physical contingencies, duties and taxes,
are estimated at US$92.1 million over the six years of the project implementation
period. Of this amount, about US$14.2 million (approximately 15 per cent of total
project costs) represent the foreign exchange component, while US$6.0 million
(approximately 6.5 per cent) are duties and taxes. Total base costs amount to
US$81.2 million, while physical and price contingencies are estimated to add to this
amount by another US$10.9 million (approximately 11.8 per cent of the base
costs). Investment costs account for 95 per cent of the base costs, and recurrent
costs for the remaining 5 per cent.
30. Component 1 (Value chain infrastructure) represents US$61.1 million, or 66.3 per
cent of project costs. Component 2 (Skills, technology and enterprise) is allocated
US$25.9 million (28. 1 per cent). Project management costs are about
US$5.1 million or 5.6 per cent of the total project costs.

Project financing and cofinancing strategy and plan
31. SAAMBAT is to be financed by the Royal Government of Cambodia (through its
national budget), an IFAD loan, an IFAD country grant and by the beneficiaries.
The financing gap of US$25.2 million may be sourced in subsequent
performance-based allocation system cycles or through cofinancing identified
during implementation. The Ministry of Economy and Finance is currently using the
SAAMBAT design to leverage further loan funds to cofinance the project, and has
initiated discussions with the European Investment Bank, with a final decision
expected by the end of 2019. If cofinancing does not materialize, there is no risk to
any of the key elements of the project design.
32. Of the total project cost, IFAD will finance US$53.2 million as a loan to the Royal
Government of Cambodia. The Government has confirmed co-funding in cash of
US$11.3 million, representing about 21 per cent of the IFAD loan. The national
budget will finance the road maintenance, estimated at around US$1.1 million. An
IFAD country grant is confirmed for US$1.2 million, and the project’s beneficiaries
will contribute US$0.14 million as an in-kind contribution to the infrastructure.

Disbursement
33. There shall be three bank accounts denominated in United States dollars (referred
to as the “designated accounts”) opened by the borrower/recipient at the National
Bank of Cambodia, through which the proceeds of the financing shall be transferred
to the three project accounts at a commercial bank, in United States dollars.
(i)
(ii)
One will be opened and maintained by the Ministry of Rural Development to
implement component 1; and
Two will be opened and maintained by the Ministry of Economy and Finance's
project implementation unit (PIU) to implement component 2; one for the
loan and one for the grant.
34. The designated accounts shall be administered following imprest account
arrangements. Advances from this financing must be segregated from other funds
for the project.
35. The statement of expenditure thresholds applicable for withdrawal applications for
all categories of expenditure under schedule 2 of the financing agreement are as
below:
(i)
“Advance withdrawal” shall be US$3,000,000 under the “works” category and
US$100,000 for all other categories; and
(ii)
“Reimbursement” shall be US$100,000 for all categories of expenditure.
36. Supporting documentation for all expenditure items, including updated contract
monitoring forms, should remain available for inspection and verification during
supervision and audit missions.
Summary of benefits and economic analysis
37. The main benefits of the project will accrue to the Cambodian economy in terms of
improved road access, which will sustainably result in savings in travel time and in
vehicle operating cost. Year-round accessible rural communities, farms and
markets will support further growth in economic activity along these roads, with
more volumes traded and better and more competitive access to farming inputs
and services, benefiting the sustainable development of rural households. In
addition, investments in agribusinesses will improve the marketing of agricultural
output, and investments in skill development programmes will improve the
involvement of youth in the formal economy.
38. Social benefits will include a reduction in poverty rates in the areas targeted by the
project. This will be the effect of the increased financial returns for households
arising from project intervention. Other social benefits include improved household
nutrition through increased incomes used to improve diets. Improved public
infrastructure will also contribute to better access to social services and a reduction
in negative health impacts from dust.
39. The economic internal rate of return of the project is estimated at 33 per cent
(base case). The sensitivity analysis shows that this could fall to 20 per cent in the
most severe scenario – still above the opportunity cost of capital in Cambodia.
Exit strategy and sustainability
40. The exit strategy for SAAMBAT is intended to ensure the sustainability of the
project’s achievements in terms of programme approach and the institutions and
public assets (real and virtual) created.
41. All infrastructure financed by component 1 of SAAMBAT will have a clearly
identified agency responsible for operation and maintenance. Paved roads will be
maintained directly by the Ministry of Rural Development. Gravel roads will be
financed subject to agreement by the local authorities to adopt and maintain them.

Facilities such as markets will be maintained by user committees. Component 1
includes funding for capacity development for road maintenance.
42. Skills learned by rural youth under subcomponent 2.1 will be of lifelong value. All
skills training courses will be based on identified gaps in the private sector and
should lead to sustainable employment. The project will also develop capacity and
teaching materials within the skills development fund (SDF) to address the
technical education needs of youth in rural areas. It is expected that the SDF will
continue to make use of this capacity beyond the lifetime of the project.
43. Subcomponent 2.2 will also assist in building sustainable institutions, including the
TSC, with capacity to support the needs of the rural economy in the future. Digital
technologies will be developed using commercial viability as a fundamental
criterion.
44. The environmental sustainability of SAAMBAT investments will be verified through
application of environmental safeguards procedures. Climate resilience will be
ensured through the integration of local climate vulnerability analyses, and by the
adoption of climate-proof design standards in line with existing standards
maintained by the international donor community.
III. Risks
A. Project risks and mitigation measures
45. SAAMBAT is considered a low-risk project overall, while some moderate risks are
identified in the Integrated Risk Framework based on the operating environment
and past experience in Cambodia. Risk of management and coordination failures
will be mitigated through a strong focus on forward planning through the annual
workplan and budget (AWP/B) and coordination through the country programme
steering committee. Sustainability risks will be mitigated through clear
responsibilities for infrastructure maintenance backed by capacity development.
Political, governance, environmental and related fiduciary concerns are assessed as
being of medium risk but manageable, based on previous country programme
experience.
B. Environment and social category
46. Based on the assessment of potential environmental and social impacts presented
in the Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures review note,
SAAMBAT has been classified as environmental and social risk category B. That is
to say that the project may have some adverse environmental and/or social
impacts on human populations or (less likely) on environmentally significant areas,
but the impacts: (i) are less adverse than those for category A; (ii) are
site-specific, with few being irreversible in nature; and (iii) can be readily remedied
by appropriate preventive actions and/or mitigation measures.
47. Social and environmental screening will be required for individual infrastructure
investments. Where significant risks are identified, social and/or environmental risk
management mitigation plans will be developed. Road subprojects will be of less
than 10 km in maximum length and will be constructed on existing road
alignments. Resettlement of households will therefore not be needed.
C. Climate risk classification
48. SAAMBAT target areas will include areas that are significantly vulnerable to
long-term climate change impacts. The project will include infrastructure
construction in areas where there is a risk of losses through flood damage, if
proper engineering design procedure – including consideration of future climate
change trends – is not followed. However, the project areas are not affected by
events of catastrophic significance. The climate risks in the project areas are well
studied and understood, and can be managed through appropriate risk

management measures. For this reason, SAAMBAT is considered to fall within the
“moderate” climate risk category.
D. Debt sustainability
49. A team from the International Monetary Fund conducted an Article IV consultation
with Cambodia in 2018, during which the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio remained at
30 per cent. Cambodia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains low risk.
IV. Implementation
A. Organizational framework
Project management and coordination
50. The Ministry of Rural Development will be the executing agency for SAAMBAT and
will establish the PMU responsible for planning, reporting and overall coordination.
This Ministry, through the PMU, will be responsible for implementing component 1.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance, through a PIU, will be responsible for
implementing component 2.
51. SAAMBAT will be coordinated with AIMS and ASPIRE and with development partner
projects through a country programme steering committee established at national
level and through multi-stakeholder platforms in each economic pole. Provincial
Departments of Rural Development (PDRDs) will coordinate the project at
sub-national level, assisted by a team of facilitators.
52. The Ministry of Rural Development will directly implement component 1, with
infrastructure investments being identified through this process. A technical
services provider will be recruited for the screening of subprojects, a feasibility
study, design and cost estimation, the ensuring of environmental and social
safeguards and climate change adaptation, and to supervise construction works in
partnership with PDRD engineers.
53. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will implement component 2 through a PIU.
The SDF unit within this ministry will lead implementation of subcomponent 2.1
(Skills for rural youth). The TSC, established within the Royal University of Phnom
Penh, will be responsible for the technical direction of subcomponent 2.2
(Technology and enterprise for agricultural value chains). The Government has
identified the independent research institution Centre for Policy Studies as
implementing partner for subcomponent 2.3 (Strategic studies, policy research and
programme development).
Financial management, procurement and governance
54. The fiduciary risk assessment is drawn from the review of Cambodia’s public
financial management system by the World Bank, published in the Public Financial
Management and Accountability Project, and the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Performance Measurement framework, which rates the inherent
country fiduciary risk as “high”. The project will: (i) establish a control framework
incorporating periodic internal audits, independent external audits and social
safeguards to be adopted based on IFAD policies; and (ii) adopt a good governance
and mutual accountability framework, to strengthen accountability and
transparency in line with international best practices.
55. SAAMBAT financial management and procurement will follow the rules and
procedures set out in the Financial Management Manual and the Procurement
Manual of the Government’s Standard Operating Procedure, with the general
exception that procedures must in all cases observe the relevant IFAD standards.
56.
In accordance with section 4.03(d) of IFAD's General Conditions for Agricultural
Development Financing, three designated accounts denominated in United States
dollars will be maintained for IFAD financing: (i) one designated account for the
loan will be opened and maintained by the Ministry of Rural Development to

implement component 1; (ii) the other designated accounts (one for the loan and
one for the grant) will be opened and maintained by the Ministry of Economy and
Finance's PIU to implement component 2.
57. A suitable web-based accounting software package will be procured. Each
implementing agency shall maintain financial records and submit monthly,
quarterly, six-monthly and annual reports to the PMU. The PMU will consolidate the
financial reports and prepare withdrawal applications for submission to the Ministry
of Economy and Finance for review.
58.
Procurement plans will be prepared and updated using the appropriate templates in
the IFAD Procurement Handbook.
59. There is limited capacity in the internal audit departments of the Ministry of Rural
Development and the implementing agencies. Therefore, a private internal audit
firm will perform a review of internal controls, propose improvements and issue
recommendations. Internal audit responsibilities will be assigned to the internal
audit departments, once these are assessed by IFAD supervision missions as
having sufficient capacity.
60. External audits will be conducted by a private audit firm hired by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, while IFAD will provide its no objection letter to the terms of
reference.
B. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge
management and communication
61. SAAMBAT will adopt integrated planning within the programmatic approach
described above. Preparation of the SAAMBAT AWP/B will be coordinated with
AWP/B preparation in AIMS and ASPIRE. The programme steering committee will
set overall direction and confirm priority objectives for the coming year.
62. Each implementing agency of SAAMBAT will prepare its AWP/B, annual targets and
priorities as agreed by the steering committee. The PMU will then consolidate the
AWP/Bs and submit them to the project director for approval, subject to the no
objection letter from IFAD.
63. The SAAMBAT logical framework sets clear and quantified targets in terms of
objectives, outcomes and outputs, linked to the IFAD Results and Impact
Management System and Operational Results Management System. Key M&E tools
will include a household impact survey, physical measurements of infrastructure
outcomes (including traffic counts), a web-based management information system,
including geographical information system capability, and annual outcome surveys
measuring interim results.
64. SAAMBAT and its alignment with other projects will provide a model for integrated
investments covering extension, marketing services, infrastructure and youth/skills
development. Learning and knowledge management will assist the Government in
refining its policy and scaling up the successful elements of the project. The IFAD
Mekong Hub will also incorporate lessons from the project across the subregion and
beyond.
Innovation and scaling up
65. The innovative aspects of SAAMBAT’s design include:
(i)
(ii)
A demand-led approach to integrated planning of production, marketing and
infrastructure development, through the multi-stakeholder platforms; and
Expanded use of digital technologies, including a balanced
upstream/downstream approach to needs identification, testing, roll-out and
strengthening capacity for the use of digital technologies in the rural
economy.

66. There is potential to scale up the programmatic approach by its adoption across
the IFAD programme and by partner agencies. The skills training is integrated
within the Government’s SDF, providing a ready pathway to scaling up. Digital
applications will be scalable once launched and proven effective, through the TSC
and its private partners.
C.
Implementation plans
Implementation readiness and start-up plans
67. The central project team has already been appointed, within both the Ministry of
Rural Development and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, even prior to
approval. Key staff have attended IFAD training sessions and were involved in the
design and negotiations. Key implementing partners have been identified and
SAAMBAT’s rationale, activities, and results agreed. SAAMBAT, AIMS and ASPIRE
have already appointed focal points for the programmatic approach, and the first
10 EPs have been identified. Implementation readiness is high, with activities on
the ground expected to start by early 2020.
68.
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans
IFAD will conduct one annual supervision mission for SAAMBAT plus additional
implementation support missions to identify practical solutions to any challenges.
The project completion report will be submitted by the Royal Government of
Cambodia within six months of completion, with evidence of the impact achieved.
V. Legal instruments and authority
69. A project financing agreement between the Kingdom of Cambodia and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached to this report.
70. The Kingdom of Cambodia is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.
71.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VI. Recommendation
72.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms
to the Kingdom of Cambodia in an amount equivalent to fifty-three million
one hundred and eighty-six thousand United States dollars (US$53,186,000),
and upon such terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance
with the terms and conditions presented herein.
RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Kingdom of
Cambodia in an amount equivalent to one million two hundred thousand
United States dollars (US$1,200,000) and upon such terms and conditions as
shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented

Project Description
1.
Target  Population.  The  Project  shall  benefit  smallholder  farmers  with potential  to
strengthen  market-led  production,  unemployed/underemployed  youth  from  poor  rural
households  who  are  willing  to  seek  formal  employment  and  enhance  their  skills
accordingly;  and  private  enterprises  and  co-operatives  which  play  an  important  role in
improving  efficiency  and  value  addition  of  key  value  chains  in  the  Economic  Poles.  The
Project  is  a  national  program,  operating  nation-wide  and  in  around  fifty  (50)  areas,
referred to as Economic Poles (EP) of small holder production of commodities targeted by
ASPIRE and AIMS (the “Project Area”).
Goal.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  and  enhance  food  security  in
2.
Cambodia.
3.
Objectives. The objective of the Project is to sustainably increase productivity of rural
youth, enterprises and the rural economy, contributing to the Goal of Reduced Poverty and
Enhanced  Food  Security.  There  are  expected  to  be  about  200,000  rural  households
benefiting from services supported by the project. About 50,000 households will be direct
beneficiaries. This  impact  will  result  from  two  Outcomes:  (1)  Poor  rural  people’s  benefits
from  market  participation  increased;  and  (2)  Poor  rural  people’s  productive  capacities
increased.
4.
Components. The Project shall consist of the following Components:
Value  Chain  Infrastructure.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to
4.1. Component 1.
benefit  poor  rural  people  through  increase  in  market  participation  by  funding
development  for  rural  infrastructure  improvement.  Physical  outputs  will  include  rural
roads;  rural  markets  and  other  value  chain  infrastructure  facilities.  Infrastructure
subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  ability  to  stimulate  private  investment
and  growth  in  value  chains  supported  by  AIMS/ASPIRE/TSSD,  particularly  the  safe
vegetable  value  chain.  The  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia  will  seek  other  potential
partners to cofinance the infrastructure.
4.2. Component 2. Skills, Technology and Enterprise. The objective of this component is
to increase poor rural people’s productive capacities by using digital technology through
the following sub-components:
4.2.1. Sub-component  2.1. Skills  for  Rural  Youth  and  Enterprises. The  Project  will  work
through the SDF and Enterprise Promotion Fund (EPF) in assisting approximately
6,800  rural  youth  to  increase  their  productivity  and  earning  potential  through
improved technical and workplace skills. The Project will engage a service provider
to develop a soft skills training curriculum, map training demand (employers and
potential  trainees)  and  training  providers  and  conduct  an  outreach  campaign  to
link  trainees  to  training  opportunities.  The  service  provider  will  also  implement  a
business  incubator  to  assist  aspiring  young  entrepreneurs  to  establish  rural
enterprises.  Outreach  activities  will  prioritise  the  SAAMBAT  Economic  Poles  but
eligible  rural  youth  will not  be  limited  to  those  who  are  resident  in the  Economic
Poles.
4.2.2. Sub-component  2.2.  Digital  Technology  and  Enterprise  for  Agricultural  Value
Chains.  The  Project  will  support  (i) the  development  of  an open  digital  platform
and  supporting  infrastructure  called  Khmer  Agriculture  Suite  (KAS);  (ii) a
5
Appendix I
EB 2019/127/R.24
Challenge  Fund  to  finance  development  and  roll-out  of  copy-right  protected
innovative commercial mobile/ digital applications for the rural economy which will
be  linked  to  KAS;  and  (iii) an  outreach  campaign  of  digital  literacy  and  digital
adoption,  uptake  of  existing  mobile  applications  and  testing  and  roll-out  support
for the KAS-linked applications.
to  strengthen

Development.
the
The  Project  will  (i) support  activities 
programmatic  approach  linking  the  IFAD  country  programme  and  the  partner
projects in a common goal setting, planning and M&E framework aligned with RGC
policy  and  IFAD corporate  priorities;  (ii) conduct  the  strategic  studies  /feasibility
and/or  pre-design  studies  of  investments  with  potential  to  benefit  small  holders,
including  a  major  feasibility  study  for  regional  wholesale  markets  for  the  safe
vegetable  value  chain; and  (iii) conduct  policy  research  to  promote  development
of  the  small  holder  agriculture  sector,  extension  of  the  digital  technology  eco
system to the rural economy. Research will also focus on mainstreaming the IFAD
11  themes  of  climate  change,  gender,  youth  and  nutrition  in  the  national  policy
framework;  and  will  inform  the  future  development  of  the  IFAD  country
programme.
