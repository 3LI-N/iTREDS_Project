Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Access to Markets Project as contained in
paragraph 50.
Proposed loan and grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for the
Access to Markets Project
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous, landlocked country of 198,500 km2 bordering China,
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Out of a total population of 5.8 million,
65 per cent live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and livestock for their
livelihoods; remittances also play an important role as an income supplement. With
an average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$1,269 in 2014,
Kyrgyzstan is classified as a lower middle-income country. Within the Debt
Sustainability Framework, it is classified as “yellow”, which means that it is eligible
for 50 per cent grant financing and 50 per cent loan financing on highly
concessional terms. With economic contraction in the Russian Federation, growth
slowed down in 2015 to 4.8 per cent from January through October – mainly a
result of the regional recession triggered by the depreciation of the Russian rouble.
2.
3.
4.
5.
Although 65 per cent of the country’s population is rural and 31 per cent of its
workforce is employed in agriculture, this sector contributed only 15.9 per cent of
total GDP in 2015 – down from 34 per cent in 2002. The main reasons are limited
access to agricultural machinery and inputs by smallholder farmers, a decline in
public expenditures for agriculture and the significant growth of the industrial and
service sectors.
Despite a declining share of GDP, agriculture and livestock are the backbone of the
economy, providing substantial employment, playing a critical role in household
food security and consumer price stability, and constituting a leading source of
exports. Food exports comprised 28.5 per cent – and agricultural raw materials
3.8 per cent – of all merchandise exports in 2013. Total gross agricultural output in
2014 was US$3 billion with crops and livestock accounting for about 50 per cent
each of this total.
Kyrgyzstan’s agricultural economy is based on approximately 360,000 family farm
units. While many of these farms have scaled up their size and operations in
response to growing internal and external market opportunities, most farms remain
small, with production geared towards subsistence and occasional commercial sale.
Many feature mixed crop-livestock farming and transhumant management of
animals (from spring and autumn pastures to summer and winter pastures).
Poverty. As a result of broad post-independence economic reforms, the poverty
rate in Kyrgyzstan declined from 52 per cent of the population in 2000 to
32 per cent in 2009. The United Nations Development Programme's Human
Development Index value for Kyrgyzstan in 2014 was 0.655, ranking 120th out of
188 countries. Poverty stood at 30.6 per cent in 2014 – 32.6 per cent in rural areas
and 26.9 per cent in urban areas – and the poverty gap was 5.4 per cent. In 2012,
20 per cent of the population subsisted on less than US$3.10 per day. Poverty is
more prevalent and most severe in rural and mountainous regions.

EB 2016/119/R.28/Rev.1
6.
Gender. While the country’s legal framework guarantees women equal rights
regarding the use and ownership of land, women face constraints in exercising their
rights due to traditions dictating that households are headed by men, in whose
names land is usually registered. A 2011 country assessment of access to land
found that Kyrgyzstan’s legal framework “has not in most cases been successful in
protecting and improving women‘s rights, including rights to access and own land”.1
The Gender Development Index, the ratio of the women to men in human
development, is 0.961, indicating that a gap still exists. The Government’s National
Sustainable Development Strategy for 2013-2017 recognizes the challenges that
Kyrgyz women are facing, including limited access to economic opportunities, a
concentration of women in the informal, high-risk labour market and violence
against women.2 In 2012, the Government adopted the National Strategy for
Gender Equality by 2020 and the National Action Plan on Gender Equality for
2012-2014.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities
7.
Although livestock production significantly contributes to rural livelihoods, nutrition,
food security, agricultural sector growth and exports, productivity is far below its
potential. The main constraints include inadequate animal feeding due to poor
utilization of pasture resources, poor animal health, inappropriate farm
management practices and weak livestock marketing and processing. While IFAD’s
ongoing programme is already addressing the first three obstacles, it is increasingly
urgent to address the obstacles to livestock marketing and processing in order to
ensure a comprehensive approach to developing the sector.
8.
9.
Kyrgyzstan has a high potential to broaden and strengthen its livestock sector
thanks to a wealth of alpine pastures and a unique biodiversity of plants and
animals. Accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) has increased the
opportunities for both agricultural exports and imports, and the EAEU has become
Kyrgyzstan’s major trading partner for food products. However, these changes have
also exposed the sector to higher levels of competition in both domestic and
regional markets, raising questions about the country’s ability to compete and
comply with the EAEU’s technical regulations.
There is a clear need to improve product aggregation within Kyrgyzstan’s livestock
value chains (including cold-chain infrastructure) in order to support the expansion
of processing while allowing smallholders to benefit. Partnering with
agroprocessors is therefore imperative to set quality standards for raw products,
including quality control and delivery mechanisms, and achieve better managed
seasonality of supply. The establishment of aggregation points confers several
benefits to value chain development, especially for smallholder farmers living in the
vicinity of agroprocessing units. Introducing these improvements to product
aggregation is central to the Government’s strategies for increased market
integration and commercialization of the livestock sector, as expressed in the
National Sustainable Development Strategy 2013-2017.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
10.
The Access to Markets Project (ATMP) is national in coverage and adopts a
demand-driven approach. ATMP’s primary target group consists of smallholder
livestock farmers who participate in and can benefit from improved value chains.
They comprise: (i) poor livestock farmers (who typically own two to three cattle
and 8 to 10 sheep or goats); (ii) women members of livestock-owning households,
including women heads of household; and (iii) other smallholder livestock farmers.

2013-2017 (2013).
2
EB 2016/119/R.28/Rev.1
Most of the poor livestock farmers are social passport holders. Other beneficiary
groups include: (iv) agroprocessors, aggregators, wholesale traders and modern
food retail formats; (v) input suppliers and service providers; (vi) private
veterinarians; (vii) national scientific and academic institute staff; and (viii) rural
unemployed people. For the latter group, project support is expected to create
employment opportunities in the on-farm and processing activities of targeted value
chains. Special attention will be paid to the participation of rural women and youth,
and their organizations as producers and entrepreneurs in processing and
marketing.
B. Project development objective
11.
The project’s goal is to contribute to increased incomes and enhanced economic
growth in pastoralist communities. Its development objective is improved access
and integration of smallholder livestock farmers into remunerative markets for their
products, leading to improved and equitable returns.
C. Components/outcomes
12.
ATMP will work with selected value chains and provide holistic and coordinated
support to different actors in order to improve these value chains’ overall
performance and increase their outputs. The project will invite champions in the
pre-selected value chains who are willing to launch or deepen their sound business
models through productive partnerships with producers and other value chain
actors. Smallholder livestock producers, who are the project’s primary target group,
will be represented in each selected value chain. Their income opportunities will
improve through better integration into the market. Pasture users unions,
facilitated by Kyrgyzstan’s Community Development and Investment Agency (ARIS)
– building on the positive experiences of the Livestock and Market Development
Programmes I and II – will play an active role in identifying and mobilizing target
groups at the community level in a transparent and participatory manner to capture
project opportunities and benefits. The project’s investments and activities will be
executed through three technical components and one project management
component.
13.
14.
Component 1: Livestock value chain development
This component will enhance capacity for sustainable, efficient livestock production,
processing and marketing. It will support efficient linkages and partnerships among
livestock value chain actors, and improve access to modern technology and good
agricultural practices with a focus on cold-chain management and traceability. The
subcomponent on capacity-building of livestock value chain stakeholders will
involve capacity-building and advisory services for the participants of pre-selected
value chains, driven by leading entities. Once the leading entities are identified, all
suppliers of raw materials and services will be gathered to present the concept of
productive partnership and its benefits to farmers and other value chain
participants. Selected proposals will be elaborated by the project-supported
business advisory service facility into value chain development business plans
(VCDBPs).
VCDBPs will be ranked against key project indicators and only those meeting the
minimum requirements will be used as frameworks for preparing individual grant or
credit projects. Selected projects will be presented to a selection panel. Value chain
capacity-building activities directly financed by ATMP will include training of farmers
and agribusiness staff, and organizing farmers into groups. The subcomponent will
also build capacity through on-farm demonstrations, piloting innovative and
climate-smart technologies, targeted advisory services and exposure to best
international practices.
15.
The subcomponent on product aggregation enhancement will address the country’s
insufficient value chain infrastructure for raw product collection and quality and

safety control. Eligible investment packages identified in VCDBPs will be cofinanced
by grants from the project.
The subcomponent on development of public-private-producer partnerships and
knowledge management will host a platform for exchange among value chain
actors for enhanced integration of market demand into production models. Through
a series of periodic meetings, a contracted service provider will enable stakeholders
to: (i) identify, discuss and assess livestock-sector constraints and priorities, and
build upon opportunities for investments; (ii) become familiar with business models
based on public-private-producer partnerships; and (iii) develop value chain
business and investment strategies. The platform will progressively engage decision
makers at the local, regional and national levels to increase their understanding of
livestock development issues and support the development of a conducive
regulatory and incentive framework for business development.
Component 2: Livestock value chain financing
This component will increase efficiency and profitability along targeted
smallholder-inclusive livestock value chains, enabling value chain actors to increase
their investments in profitable livestock value chains through the provision of
grants under component 1 and links to external credit. Activities will include the
development of innovative financial products for agricultural producers and
processors through cooperation with financial service providers (FSPs).
The subcomponent on access to external credit lines will link financial initiatives
targeting agricultural development with the producers and processors identified and
assisted through component 1. A memorandum of understanding will be signed
with each FSP outlining the eligibility criteria for prospective borrowers, which will
be standard for all project partners, and the specific arrangements designed to link
component 1 beneficiaries with FSPs. This subcomponent will only facilitate
partnerships with FSPs that are interested in developing innovative financial
products for agriculture, and committed to piloting these products and documenting
lessons learned.
Component 3: Upgrading the Kyrgyz livestock sanitary system
This component aims to strengthen the public- and private-sector arms of the
Kyrgyz veterinary authority, which facilitate livestock commodity trade and ensure
food safety. The expected outcome will include an upgraded Kyrgyz livestock
sanitary system, which will be measured by a 10 per cent increase in the export of
live animals and livestock products.
The subcomponent on strengthening the state veterinary sanitary system will assist
the State Inspectorate for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Security (SIVPSS) in
harmonizing its sanitary standards with those of EAEU trading partners. To facilitate
this, the project will invest in upgrading critical competencies of the public
veterinary service as defined by the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE) in
order to meet international standards. These investments will focus on building the
capacity of SIVPSS staff and supporting the Government in animal identification
within selected value chains.
The subcomponent on strengthening the private veterinary practice system will
support to the Kyrgyz Veterinary Association through study tours, technical
assistance, office equipment and communications, translation and publication of
technical training materials. Most importantly, this subcomponent will train master
trainers (along with contracted subject-matter specialists) to upgrade the skills of
community-based veterinarians and para-veterinarians. Support will also be
provided to the Kyrgyz Veterinary Chamber, established through an IFAD- and
World Bank-funded project as a veterinary statutory body according to OIE
standards. Support to this body will be limited to increasing server capacity (i.e.
additional databases) and updating computers, printers and other communication
equipment.

Approach
The project will be executed through a demand-driven approach rather than
through the planning and definition of fixed targets. Participation will be promoted
by the public sector (the push factor) while the direct involvement of qualified
private companies will be sought for the role of leading entities (the pull factor).
ATMP also proposes a cluster approach to implementation whereby agribusinesses
benefit from technical assistance, better raw materials and access to client-tailored
financial services, while smallholders have increased access to markets and
incomes from their livestock. This approach will also provide for stronger
farmer-agribusiness linkages that generate positive outcomes such as improved
animal productivity, better cold-chain infrastructure and more jobs in rural areas,
including for youth.
Through the project’s value chain-wise approach, the entry point is the value chain
champion (also referred to as a leading entity). ATMP will promote the development
of viable business models (productive partnerships) and promote trust and mutual
collaboration among value chain actors. The project aims to demonstrate that
implementing business models compliant with international food safety standards is
sustainable and credit worthy. All interested value chain stakeholders will be invited
to apply for the role of leading entity.
The project will ensure women’s inclusion in value chains and equitable access to
opportunities. The gender strategy will include: identification of non-traditional
livestock products that will benefit women producers; promotion of women’s
employment, especially at the higher levels of value chains (processing, retailing,
etc.); and active communication of potential new roles for women in livestock value
chains.
Organizational framework
The two major institutions responsible for successful implementation of
IFAD-financed projects are the Agricultural Projects Implementation Unit (APIU) of
the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration, and ARIS. These
institutions will have primary responsibility for implementing ATMP. The Ministry of
Agriculture and Melioration will be the implementing agency for the project and
APIU will be responsible for overall project implementation, coordination, oversight
and reporting to IFAD and the Government. This includes liaising closely with ARIS,
which will operate independently but will be accountable to APIU as part of the
project implementation team. ARIS will be responsible for all community-level
project implementation, with a focus on pasture users unions and smallholder
groups, and for the administration of all project grant funds.
Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
The project’s logical framework will form the basis for a results-based monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) system including performance monitoring and impact
assessment. An extended version of the logical framework has been prepared to
ensure more comprehensive project M&E. APIU’s M&E staff will be responsible for
all internal project M&E.
In addition to the M&E arrangements described above, IFAD supervision will include
operational reviews of the project covering a random sample of activities, to be
carried out in project years two and four by independent auditors and under terms
of reference acceptable to IFAD. External monitoring will also comprise: risk-based
financial management supervisions; ad hoc thematic studies; yearly audits; and a
self-assessment project completion evaluation conducted by APIU in cooperation
with IFAD.
5
EB 2016/119/R.28/Rev.1
29.
Learning and knowledge management. To ensure that experiences from the
project are captured and used for learning, M&E outputs will be widely disseminated
and there will be a participatory approach to establishing the project’s management
information system. The public-private-producer partnership platform is expected
to play a major role in consolidating lessons learned.
Financial management, procurement and governance
D.
30. Governance and financial management risks. The country risk is rated as high:
Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index ranked Kyrgyzstan 123
out of 167 countries in 2015, with a score of 28 (up from 27 in 2014). The 2014
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Framework shows considerable
improvement in several areas of earlier weakness in the country’s public financial
management as a result of its reforms. Despite these improvements however, some
areas remain weak and require further improvement, including internal financial
controls, payroll controls and failure of a World Bank-funded project to implement
fully automated treasury and human resources management information systems.
31.
Financial management. APIU and ARIS will be responsible for financial
management of the project; APIU will be supported by pre-identified implementing
partners. APIU’s financial management department and ARIS staff are experienced
in financial management of IFAD projects. To ensure workload balance and
segregation of duties, additional disbursement officers for APIU and ARIS will be
competitively recruited to assist in project financial management.
32. Accounting and financial reporting arrangements. The project will adopt
accounting procedures and policies consistent with international accounting
standards (cash basis). Financial reports will be consolidated by APIU, which will
also be responsible for ensuring that funds are used for their intended purposes by
implementing partners. Eligible expenditures from IFAD loan and grant resources
will be utilized by APIU and ARIS for their respective activities, and the units will be
responsible for all expenditures from IFAD and counterpart contributions.
Consolidated quarterly financial reports will be furnished by APIU to IFAD. All
financial statements will be in formats acceptable to IFAD.
33. Disbursement arrangements and flow of funds. Four designated accounts
denominated in United States dollars will be opened for the project by the
borrower/recipient at a commercial bank to receive the loan and grant proceeds.
This includes two designated accounts each for APIU and ARIS (one for the loan
and one for the grant). The designated accounts will be replenished through an
imprest system. Four operating accounts in local currency will be opened by the
borrower/recipient to receive transfers from the corresponding designated
accounts.
34. Audit. Given the geographical spread of the project, and to ensure that funds are
used for their intended purposes, the project will be audited by the ARIS internal
audit department as part of its annual work programme. An internal audit firm will
be hired midway through implementation to carry out internal and performance
audits of activities implemented by APIU and its implementing partners. Annual
consolidated financial statements will be audited by a private audit firm in
accordance with the International Standards on Auditing under terms of reference
cleared annually by IFAD.
35. Procurement. As part of the project design, IFAD assessed the procurement
capacity of APIU and ARIS using the IFAD Tool for Assessment of Agency Capacity
to Implement Procurement. These agencies’ procurement capacity and procedures
were assessed as satisfactory for all aspects of procurement including
advertisement, drafting of bidding documentation, evaluation and contract
management.

Supervision
A supervision plan covering the period until the midterm review will be agreed upon
at the start of implementation. ATMP will be supervised directly by IFAD.
IV. Project costs, financing, and benefits
A. Project costs
37.
The total investment and incremental recurrent project costs, including physical and
price contingencies, are estimated at US$55.4 million (KGS 3.9 billion). Physical
and price contingencies are 2 per cent of the total project costs and investments
associated with grants and external credit represent approximately 66 per cent of
the total project costs (expressed as a lump sum with no contingencies).

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
39.
Expected project results include: (i) increased farm-level livestock productivity;
(ii) higher quantity and quality of livestock for processing and consumption;
(iii) reduced losses during storage and transportation; (iv) flatter seasonal supply
and more stable prices for producers and collectors of produce; (v) enhanced
processing quality and efficiency; (vi) greater product diversification; and
(vii) increased commercialization of the sector, resulting in expanded employment
and higher incomes for farming households and rural entrepreneurs. The project is
expected to reach approximately 28,000 households with its activities and
investments. Benefits will accrue from: (i) increased livestock productivity and
greater production due to the application of improved inputs and enhanced
husbandry; (ii) an increase in marketed farm produce; (iii) reduced losses during
production and processing of dairy and meat produce through innovative
technologies; (iv) improved quality and safety of agricultural and food products,
attracting higher prices as a result of processors’ demand for more reliable outputs;
(v) an increase in exports of livestock commodities; (vi) a minimized risk of
zoonotic diseases from an improved animal sanitary system; (vii) enhanced access
to credit; (viii) increased employment for hired and family labour in on-farm and
off-farm activities; and (ix) greater tax revenues as a result of an increased volume
of taxable production.
40.
The project economic analysis indicates that the gains of the total investments in
ATMP are significant and robust in economic terms. The analysis results in an
internal economic rate of return of 19 per cent and a net present value of
US$45 million over 20 years, with quantifiable benefits that directly relate to
project activities.
D. Sustainability
41.
The sustainability of project results is based on: (i) the value chain development
and technical capacity-building activities promoted; (ii) the demand-driven nature
of the intervention; and (iii) the preparation of VCDBPs as the basis for all
investments, which will lead to better-integrated and more equitable and profitable
value chains.

EB 2016/119/R.28/Rev.1
E. Risk identification and mitigation
42.
The main risk involves a potential failure to align the commercial and financial
incentives for the various actors to engage in public-private-producer partnerships
– including farmers, companies and FSPs participating in the project. Mitigating
measures include an in-depth, participatory analysis of: production and other
business opportunities; input-related and other constraints; and financial risks
based on formulated bankable business plans. Inherent risks and control risks for
the project are rated as high and medium respectively. The residual overall financial
management risk is rated as medium after the implementation of appropriate
risk-mitigation measures to ensure accountability of funds.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
ATMP is aligned with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, especially strategic
43.
objective 2: increase poor rural people’s benefits from market participation and its
associated areas of thematic focus: (i) diversified rural enterprise and employment
opportunities; (ii) rural investment environment; and (iii) rural producers’
organizations. The project design is also fully compliant with IFAD’s policies on
targeting, gender mainstreaming, rural finance and climate change. In recognition
of the new Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures, the project
will aim for compliance in programme implementation at the management and field
levels.
B.
44.
C.
45.
D.
46.
Alignment and harmonization
The project is closely aligned with and supports the Government’s priorities and
strategies for increased market integration and commercialization of the livestock
sector, as expressed in the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2013-2017.
It also supports the priorities and strategies for nutrition and food security in
Kyrgyzstan’s Concept of Food Security 2009-2019.
Innovations and scaling up
The project will take a pilot approach to the development of efficient, sustainable
livestock value chain development in Kyrgyzstan, field testing innovative
technologies and building the capacity of supporting institutions. The experiences
derived from the project will be replicated in other parts of the country with similar
value chains. There is also the potential for scaling up and synergies in relation to
future donor-funded projects.
Policy engagement
The platform for public-private-producer partnership development is expected to be
the entry point for policy dialogue on the development of a conducive regulatory
and incentive framework for business development in the rural sector. This will
complement the ongoing policy dialogue on natural resource management and
climate resilience in the context of current projects within the country programme.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
