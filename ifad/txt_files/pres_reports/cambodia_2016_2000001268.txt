Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Accelerating Inclusive Markets for
Smallholders Project as contained in paragraph 39.
Proposed loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the
Accelerating Inclusive Markets for Smallholders Project
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
Cambodia has made dramatic progress in reducing poverty over the last decade.
Between 2004 and 2012, poverty was reduced from 53 per cent to 17.5 per cent,
surpassing all expectations and exceeding the Millennium Development Goal
poverty target. More than 4.3 million people have moved out of poverty during this
period – mostly in rural areas – with the number of poor people dropping from
almost 7 million in 2004 to below 2.5 million in 2012 (World Bank, 2015). The
country’s vibrant and pro-poor agricultural growth was the key driver of this
dramatic reduction in poverty. More than 60 per cent of Cambodia’s poverty
reduction was attributed to the agriculture sector: higher rice prices stimulated
greater rice production, which helped to increase farm wages (World Bank, 2013).
Between 2004 and 2012, the annual growth in gross agricultural production was
8.7 per cent and agricultural value added grew by 5.3 per cent during this period.
2.
3.
Despite this significant reduction in poverty, many of the 4.3 million people that
have moved out of poverty are still vulnerable. This is because the majority of
them are still "near-poor" and are therefore extremely susceptible to slipping back
into poverty if shocks occur. Indeed, almost all of the gains of the last decade
could be reversed by an average loss of KHR 1,200 per day (US$0.30), which
would return 3 million near-poor people into poverty and raise Cambodia’s poverty
rate to 40 per cent (based on 2011 poverty data; World Bank, 2013).
Additional poverty reduction will depend on the success of agriculture in the
coming years since this sector involves a large share of the labour force and has a
major role in exports. Farmers are among the country’s poorest and most
vulnerable people, and the factors that drove Cambodia’s growth – especially
higher rice prices and expansion of production – are unlikely to drive significant
further growth. Continued poverty reduction will depend on finding new ways to
expand Cambodia's agricultural sector in terms of overall agricultural growth,
higher returns (especially returns on labour) and inclusiveness of growth.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
4.
5.
RB-COSOP
Since Cambodia’s dramatic poverty reduction was largely driven by agriculture,
most poverty reduction occurred in rural areas. Given the importance of agriculture
in the rural economy, continued agricultural growth is crucial to promote further
poverty reduction and economic growth in rural communities. If farm incomes are
to keep pace with non-farm wages, returns on agricultural labour need to rise
dramatically; however agricultural growth has stalled. In order to continue
Cambodia’s poverty reduction and inclusive growth, there is a need to restart
agricultural growth through intensification, diversification and commercialization.
Fortunately, there are currently market opportunities for higher-return agricultural
growth and a number of important developments are enabling Cambodian farmers
and agribusinesses to capitalize on these opportunities. These include a rapidly
improving rural finance sector, promising market-support and production

initiatives, and farmers’ increasing interest in market opportunities for
agribusiness. However: many smallholders still cannot access financing for
investments in their farms; value chains are highly fragmented, leading to high
transaction costs; many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are informal,
which limits their capacity to invest and their understanding of new markets; many
agribusinesses struggle to aggregate supply from several smallholder farmers; and
major capacity gaps exist in competitive on-farm production and post-harvest
management. Tackling these challenges is vital if Cambodian agriculture is to
compete in both export markets and against imports from neighbouring countries.
The rationale for the Accelerating Inclusive Markets for Smallholders (AIMS) Project
is to: (i) identify a portfolio of promising growth opportunities; and (ii) work with
actors in the value chain to identify and address bottlenecks to faster growth. This
requires filling gaps in networks, skills and resources to forge a practical pathway
to growth.
The project design is consistent with the strategic objectives of the 2013-2018
country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP), specifically its first strategic
objective to enable poor smallholders to take advantage of market opportunities. It
is closely aligned with the Government’s policies for rural development, including
the Rectangular Strategy’s resolve to make agriculture a leading sector in the
nation’s economy and source of sustainable economic growth, and to increase food
security and reduce poverty. The project is also aligned with the Cambodia Trade
Integration Strategy 2014-2018, which addresses issues of trade-sector
competitiveness, job and income creation, and sustainable human development.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
8.
Project area. The project will be implemented in all parts of the country, with
actual locations determined by the selection of priority value chains. AIMS will
initially work in 15 provinces based on the section of five flagship commodities to
be supported by five multistakeholder platforms and three inter-regional technical
hubs.
9.
The project’s primary beneficiaries will be smallholder farm households, including
poor and near-poor farmers, and women-headed households participating in the
supported value chains and voluntarily collaborating in project activities. Secondary
target groups include other value-chain actors such as agricultural cooperatives,
farmer organizations, SMEs, agribusinesses, service enterprises and industry
associations. The project will aim to make agriculture and value-chain integration
more attractive to the younger generation as a profitable business.
B. Project development objective
10. The project’s development objective is to increase returns from farming for
smallholders, including poor farmers and youth, through efficient public-sector
investment. There are expected to be 75,000 direct household beneficiaries of the
project with increased assets of at least 25 per cent.
C. Components/outcomes
11. The project will have two technical components and one project management
component:
Component 1: Value chain development will focus on brokering,
facilitation, innovation and capacity-building to support the inclusive growth
of five high-value product value chains covering crops and livestock. Value
chain brokering and facilitation through a cluster approach will form the core
of the component’s approach. This cluster approach will geographically group
key actors along the value chain in the same geographic areas. For AIMS,
value-chain actors will typically be defined by zones of production, which form
discrete buying zones that include a number of competing buyers and
traders.

IFAD’s public-private-producer partnership models will be drawn upon for the
supported contract farming arrangements. Building on both existing and
emerging production clusters, the project will: (i) follow a consistent process
to develop and promote links between buyers, producers and service
providers through multistakeholder platforms and contract farming
mechanisms; (ii) give priority to innovation in local value chains, especially
through a value chain innovation fund (VCIF) and; (iii) promote the
development of local markets for private-sector support services.
Component 2: Value chain financing will aim to increase private
investment in priority value chains by farmers, SMEs, agricultural
cooperatives, agribusinesses, service providers and others. Priorities for the
investment agenda in each value chain will be driven by the private
value-chain actors via the brokerage and facilitation process supported
through component 1. The value chain financing component will employ a
two-pronged approach to stimulate private investment in priority value
chains. This approach will be implemented through two sub-components:
(i) 2.1 Value chain investment support. AIMS will provide direct financial
support to stimulate private investment through the VCIF and a credit
line for policy-based financing to be administered by the Rural
Development Bank or a third-party fund administrator. The total value of
investment support will be approximately US$18 million. The total value
of support grants and loans available to each value chain through the
VCIF and line of credit should be broadly proportionate to the expected
development outcomes of that value chain (including the number of
farmers benefiting and each farmer’s increased profit). Only investments
assessed as commercially feasible will be eligible.
(ii) 2.2 Financial service provider partnerships. Private investment in
high-value agriculture can only be accelerated with significantly increased
financing from banks and microfinance institutions to farmers,
agricultural cooperatives, SMEs, agribusinesses and service providers.
AIMS will initially partner with three major microfinance institutions with
substantial agricultural portfolios and the internal capacity to lend for
agriculture (for example having dedicated agricultural finance officers).
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
12. The project design is based on the following principles:
(a) Only commercially viable value chains and investments will be supported.
This is essential for supported value chains to sustain long-term
competitiveness and self-sufficiency after project implementation without
public subsidies.
(b)
(c)
To attract IFAD support, value chains must have real potential for inclusive
growth and involve significant numbers of poor farmers who are able to earn
profits from the growing value chains along with other enterprises.
From the start, AIMS will promote the development of critical business-
support services and input markets, which are a vital to sustaining a
competitive industry that strengthens the primary value chain.
(d) AIMS will build the capacity of individuals, institutions, networks and systems
while delivering project results.
(e)
The project will promote learning from best practices elsewhere, refining and
adapting approaches that work well in the Cambodian context.
B. Organizational framework
13.
Project implementation will be primarily decentralized, with overall project
coordination provided by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) as lead implementation

agency (LIA). MOC will support project activities through three regional hubs and
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will collaborate with the contracted
fund administrator for the VCIF and the Rural Development Bank or a qualified
private bank for the line of credit.
14. MOC will be the lead executing agency for the project and will lead component 1,
with the responsibility of coordinating business development and agriculture
marketing. This ministry will host a project management office (PMO), which will
include the component 1 management team led by the AIMS project director. The
PMO will be responsible for overall financial management, reporting and
administration in collaboration with the MOC Directorate General for Domestic
Trade. The Department for International Cooperation of MOC will be responsible for
financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
communication and reporting.
15. MEF will be the implementing agency for component 2 (value chain financing). The
component 2 team will establish a management office within this ministry, which
will supervise the appointed VCIF fund administrator and Rural Development Bank
or a qualified private bank in relation to the line of credit. Overall, as per its
borrower’s representative role, MEF will also be responsible for: (i) inter-agency
coordination; (ii) providing government fiduciary oversight and management;
(iii) providing sufficient and timely counterpart contributions to finance project
activities, including payment of government staff salaries; and (iv) timely
processing of withdrawal applications, procurement approvals and other necessary
documents according to standard operating procedures.
C. Planning, M&E, and learning and knowledge management
16. Planning and M&E. Planning processes and schedules within AIMS will be
harmonized with the regular planning processes of MEF and MOC. A major focus for
M&E will be the establishment of a highly effective management information
system (including online and offline, Internet and mobile devices) to provide
project managers and value chain teams with timely and reliable information on
developments in each priority value chain. This will allow intervention plans to be
assessed and information and networks from neighboring provinces and countries
to be integrated.
17. The M&E system will utilize regularly updated results chains and M&E frameworks
for each priority value chain to compliment IFAD’s Results and Impact Management
System (RIMS), and the project logframe. The use of results chains for individual
value chains will enable the identification and tracking of change indicators for each
value chain and cluster. The results chains will also be powerful tools for
communication among value-chain stakeholders regarding opportunities,
bottlenecks and joint action
18. Learning and knowledge management. Effective and efficient learning,
knowledge management and communication are central to meeting the project’s
objective through communities of practice, social networks and online systems.
AIMS will invest in high-quality, evidence-based knowledge management in order
to contribute to policy development. The project will also seek to strengthen
institutional capacity related to policy-based financing for sector development,
trade research and facilitation. In this context, AIMS will support targeted
institutional strengthening activities and project management will integrate
effective knowledge management and communication. The knowledge
management and communication strategy will play an important role in ensuring
that the project achieves its indented outcomes. This strategy will be coordinated
by the Department for International Cooperation on behalf of the PMO and will
include a full-time knowledge management and communications officer from this
department.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
19. Financial management. The project’s financial management will be in line with
the standard operating procedures for externally funded projects (used by all

donor-funded programmes in Cambodia) and supervised by IFAD to ensure that:
(i) funds are used efficiently and for intended purposes; (ii) disbursements of
project funds facilitate rapid implementation; (iii) funds are well managed and flow
smoothly; (iv) accurate financial reports are issued in a timely manner; (v) a
robust flow of reliable information on project activities ensures accountability; and
(vi) project assets and resources are safeguarded. The Ministries of Commerce and
Economy and Finance will be authorized to manage all project-related bank
accounts, including those utilized for government counterpart funding.
20. Flow of funds. As lead executing agency, MOC shall open and maintain a
designated account in United States dollars at the National Bank of Cambodia to
receive the loan proceeds from the account maintained by IFAD and an account in
United States dollars to receive and manage the government counterpart funds for
the project. MOC shall open a project bank account for the implementation of
component 1. MEF shall open a project bank account for the implementation of
component 2 and coordination activities.
21. Procurement. Procurement shall be carried out in accordance with the updated
standard operating procedures promulgated under the law on public procurement
for implementing all externally funded projects. The standard operating procedures
detail the procedures, processes, good governance framework and controls as
established in the procurement manual. Government rules and procedures will be
applied and as long they are consistent with IFAD’s procurement guidelines.
22.
Internal control and external audit. All procedures for project implementation
and management will be documented in the project implementation manual and
consistently applied. The manual shall include provisions regulating the
establishment of internal controls, monitoring and review of transactions, and
accounting software requirements. An independent private auditor will be hired for
the annual audit of consolidated financial statements (including those prepared by
both MEF and MOC). Proper terms of reference for audits will be an important
safeguard for all stakeholders. These terms of reference will include visits to
implementing partners and service providers, and field visits when appropriate. The
audited financial statements and audit reports will be submitted to IFAD within the
six months following the close of each fiscal year.
23. Governance. A project level good governance framework will cover procurement,
financial management, disclosure, civil society participation, ethical conduct,
sanctions and project-specific issues. The project will support the strengthening of
national financial management and procurement capacity.
E. Supervision
24. AIMS will be jointly supervised by the Government and IFAD. Joint supervision
missions will be conducted at least once per financial year with additional
implementation support missions mobilized as necessary. A mid-term review shall
be conducted jointly by the borrower and IFAD at the end of the third project year
to: assess the progress, achievements, constraints, emerging impacts and
sustainability of the project, and make recommendations and necessary
adjustments for the remainder of the disbursement period.
IV. Project costs, financing, and benefits
A. Project costs
25. The total project cost is estimated at US$62.1 million. Indicative costs for each
component are detailed in table 1. Indicative project costs by expenditure category

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
27. AIMS will generate financial and social benefits by introducing improved
agricultural practices, commercial farming of high-value crops and improved post-
harvest management in rain-fed and irrigated crop and livestock production.
Financial benefits will include greater incomes for households targeted by the
project. Social benefits will include reduced poverty in the targeted project areas as
a result of increased household income and improved employment opportunities in
the agriculture sector.
28. The economic rationale for AIMS is based on: (i) improved agricultural productivity
and reduction of post-harvest losses as a result of the introduction of improved
technologies; and (ii) increased cropping intensity and cultivation of high-value
crop varieties and livestock with drip irrigation to expand dry-season production.
With a potential increase in yields of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent from
drip-irrigation, these improved production practices and integrated soil fertility
measures are expected to significantly improve household incomes.
29. The economic analysis of the project indicates that AIMS is robust in economic
terms. The overall economic internal rate of return is estimated at 31.9 per cent,
which is above the opportunity cost of capital in Cambodia. The economic internal
rate of return was estimated based on the assumption that 70 per cent of target

farmers will adopt the improved technology promoted by the project, and will
expand the use of drip-irrigation cultivation.
D. Sustainability
30.
Financial sustainability is at the core of the AIMS approach, which seeks to catalyze
profitable private-led investments by farmers and businesses into value chains and
associated private service enterprises. The project is expected to facilitate the
successful operation of farmer groups, agribusinesses and other enterprises in each
value chain. Institutional sustainability of critical value-chain facilitation activities
will be achieved by building strong and mutually beneficial relationships among
farmers, private businesses and government agencies, especially via
multistakeholder platforms and regional hub teams.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
31. The main identified risks include: (i) ineffective targeting of poor smallholders;
(ii) a lack of market opportunities, which may limit the scale of impact;
(iii) unfamiliar approaches to market-oriented agriculture development;
(iv) insufficient flexibility in resource allocation and action plans; and (v) a lack of
coordination between national and sub-national agencies, and the private sector.
To mitigate these risks, the project will: (i) ensure rigorous and objective value
chain assessment and selection; (ii) select and screen five initial products targeted
to the domestic and export markets for market demand and profitability;
(iii) provide intensive and sustained technical assistance (including social
mobilization) and mainstream value chain activities, taking into account previous
experiences in the region; and (iv) ensure that managers have up-to-date
information on each value chain through M&E systems based on current best
practices (e.g. the Donor Committee for Enterprise Development Standard). In
addition, MEF will: (i) ensure overall coordination; (ii) implement the project
through field-based hub offices; and (iii) directly involve stakeholders in project
delivery as members of regional hub teams and in project governance via the
project steering committee.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
32. The design of AIMS complies with IFAD policies and strategies on targeting,
gender, indigenous peoples, environmental and natural resource management, and
private-sector engagement. Consideration has been given in project design to
gender in the division of labour within selected value chains and to the barriers
women face in project participation. Most of the activities related to environmental
impact fall under category B.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
33. The multistakeholder platform that will be implemented by AIMS in each value
chain cluster will provide a sub-national forum for all stakeholders to harmonize
their support of local value chains, including other development actors. AIMS will
be harmonized with other major projects including the Agriculture Services
Programme for Innovation, Resilience and Extension implemented by the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which will strengthen public and private
extension services and decentralize investment budgets through programme-based
budgeting. This will enable provincial departments of agriculture to respond to local
priorities identified through multistakeholder platforms. AIMS will also be
harmonized with the Boosting Food Production Project, implemented by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries General Directorate of Agriculture,
which will complement AIMS activities in the rice sector and share joint
multistakeholder platforms for vegetables in common provinces. In addition, AIMS
will build on the progress of a project supported by the French Development
Agency in the rice sector and planned value chain infrastructure investments in the
forthcoming Asian Development Bank Value Chain Project, which will also support
value chains and provinces targeted by AIMS.

Innovations and scaling up
C.
34. The review of the 2008-2012 COSOP identified the need for a more pragmatic
approach to maximize synergies between projects, improve knowledge
management, harmonize with development partners and ensure sustained
improvements in the capacity of public extension services. The scaling up study
also emphasized the importance of improved knowledge management and the
identification of opportunities. AIMS responds to the recommendation of this study
that IFAD [in Cambodia] rebalance its operational goals with more of an emphasis
on becoming truly a learning and scaling-up organization. This will be
operationalized through the project’s multistakeholder value chain initiatives and
its explicit focus on learning, knowledge management and communication.
Policy engagement
D.
35. AIMS will invest in high-quality, evidence-based knowledge management in order
to contribute to policy development. The project also seeks to strengthen
institutional capacity related to policy-based financing for sector development and
trade research and facilitation. In this context, AIMS will support targeted
institutional strengthening activities. The knowledge management and
communication strategy will ensure that evidence-based policy analysis reaches
key decision makers in a useable form while facilitating broad-based stakeholder
engagement policy dialogue.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
36. A project financing agreement between the Kingdom of Cambodia and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I.
37. The Kingdom of Cambodia is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.
38.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
39.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms
to the Kingdom of Cambodia in the amount of thirty-six million three hundred
thousand United States Dollars (US$36,300,000) and upon such terms and
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.

Schedule 1
Project Description and Implementation Arrangements
I.
Project Description
40. Target  Population. The  Project  shall  benefit  to  smallholder  farm  households,
including  poor  and  near  poor  farmers,  participating  in  the  supported  value  chains  who
voluntarily  collaborate  in project  activities,  including  as  well, agricultural  cooperatives;
farmer  organisations,  Micro  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs),  agribusinesses,
service enterprises, and industry associations. The project shall operate in all parts of the
country, with actual locations determined by the selection of priority value chains and the
associated areas engaged in the value chains from production to the market. The Project
will  initially  work  in  around  15  provinces  based  on  the  5  flagship  commodities  selected
supported  by  the  same  number  of  multi-stakeholder  platforms  and  3 inter-regional
technical hubs (the “Project Area”).
Goal. The  Project  goal  is  to  enhance  prosperity  of  Cambodian  smallholder  farmers
2.
through increasingly profitable links to agri-businesses and markets.
3.
Objective.  The  objective  of  the  Project  is to  increase  returns  from  farming  for
smallholders,  including  poorer  farmers  and  youth,  through  efficient  public  sector
investment.  There  are  expected  to  be  75,000  direct  household  beneficiaries  from  the
Project within increased household assets of at least 25 per cent.
4.
Components. The Programme shall consist of the following two components:
Value Chains Development (VCs). The objective of this component
4.1. Component 1.
is  to  focus  on  brokering,  facilitation,  innovations  development  and  capacity  building
support  to  inclusive  growth  initially  of  five  higher  value  product  value  chains - covering
food and non-food crops and livestock through (i) Clusters grouping the key actors along
the  value  chain  in  the  same  areas,  (ii)  Multi  Stakeholder  Platforms  (MSP) bringing
together  all  the  actors  and  stakeholders  in  the  VCs  for  shared  understanding  and  joint
actions  to  address  constraints  and  maximize opportunities  in  VCs  for  mutual  benefits,
market,  processing  and  business  linkages (iii) Market-oriented  social  mobilizers  working
with  the  Regional  Hubs  Offices  to  mobilize  farmers  and  youth  into  the  local  VCDs
(vi) Sector  Development  Facility  (SDF) focusing  on  public  goods  addressing  specific
bottlenecks to the VCs development identified by the VCs actors themselves through the
MSP dialogue processes at the regional hub and cluster levels.
Value  Chain  Financing.
4.2. Component 2.
The  objective  of  this component  is  to
stimulate  increased  private  investment  into  the  priority  VCs  by  farmers,  MSMEs,
agricultural cooperatives, agribusinesses, services providers and others, and by providing
them  better  knowledge  to  take  on  their  own  investment  decision,  through  the  following
sub-components:
4.2.1. Sub-component 2.1. Value  chain  investment  support. The  Project  will  provide
direct financial support to stimulate private investment through the following two
instruments for policy-based financing:
(i)
a  Value  Chain  Innovation  Fund  (VCIF)  providing  targeted  investment
incentives  to  first  mover  private  investors  (farmers,  agricultural  co-
operatives, MSMEs, agribusinesses) along the selected value chains in order
to  foster  potential  adopters  of  new  technologies  or  business  models  with
unknown risks and  economic benefits to actually adopt these  and test their
validity.  This  VCIF  will initially  operate  three  Windows  targeting  a  particular
4
Appendix I
EB 2016/119/R.23/Rev.1
(ii)
scale  of  investment  (Smallholder  farm  investments,  Small  enterprise
investments  and  Medium  business  investments) and  linked  to  the  function
along the value chain. Investment incentives will be implemented via partial
matching  grants  to  private  investors,  based  on  selected  investment  plans
through  a  competitive  process  targeted  specifically  at  the  identified
bottlenecks in each VC that emerge through the multi-stakeholder platforms.
a  Credit  Line providing RDB  or  qualified  private  bank  with  liquidity  for
lending  along  the  VCs  supported  under  the  Project, and  to  refinance  up  to
80%  of the loans granted by the  Partner Financial Institutions (PFIs) linked
to  the  VCIF  to  permit  PFIs  respect  asset-liability  matching  in  the  case  of
term loans with a duration of more than 2 years. To this end, MEF and RDB
or  qualified  private  bank  will  sign  a  subsidiary  agreement  in  the  form  and
substance  provided  in  the  PIM. The  draft  subsidiary  agreement  shall  be
approved by the Fund and the Lead Project Implementation Agency prior to
its  signature. RDB  or  qualified  private  bank will  require  targeted Technical
Assistance  (TA)  in  strategy  development  and  capacity  development.  Loans
provided  through  this  credit  line  will  be  targeted  towards  investments
addressing specific bottlenecks in the VC.
4.2.2. Sub-component 2.2.
Financial  service  provider  partnerships. The  objectives
of this sub-component are mainly to create, test and widen partnerships between
investors  in  the  agricultural  sector,  in  particular  into  commodities  and  VCs
selected  under  the  Project,  and  the  financial  sector,  with  a  view  to  increase  the
volume of finance flowing into the sector, and to create sustainable and profitable
models  for  financial  service  delivery  to  the  agricultural  sector.  The  Project  will
initially  start  partnering  with  three  mainstream  Micro  Finance  Institutions  (MFIs)
having: (i) substantial existing portfolios in agriculture (ii) taken specific steps to
strengthen  their  internal  capacity  to  lend  to  agriculture.  These  three  MFIs  will
require some additional TA during the second half of the Project in both strategy
development and overall building of capacity.

typically expected to include farmers adopting at least 2/3 of the components of an improved technology package for production a specific crop/livestock. Each of the technology components
will be clearly defined and objectively verifiable, similar to what is already practiced in PADEE and ASPIRE projects
