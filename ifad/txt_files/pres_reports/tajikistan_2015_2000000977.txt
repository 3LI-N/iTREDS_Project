Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendations for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Livestock and Pasture Development
Project II, as contained in paragraph 38.
Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for
the Livestock and Pasture Development Project II
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
The Republic of Tajikistan is a landlocked country with mountainous areas
accounting for some 93 per cent of the total land area, and a population of
8.2 million. Tajikistan’s economy has grown by more than 8 per cent per annum
since 2000, but growth slowed from 7.4 per cent in 2013 to 6.7 per cent in 2014 as
remittance inflow, equivalent to almost half of Tajikistan’s GDP, fell by 8.3 per cent.
Remittances from about one million labour migrants account for as much as
25 per cent of total household income, making the country highly vulnerable to
external economic shocks. The country’s remoteness, obsolescent infrastructure,
deteriorating education and health systems, and lack of government resources are
significant barriers to economic and social development.
2.
3.
4.
The agriculture sector accounts for only about 21 per cent of the country’s GDP, but
plays a crucial role in the rural population’s livelihoods and food security. The
population of Tajikistan was 73.4 per cent rural in 2013, with the majority engaged
in agriculture, which accounted for 75 per cent of total employment. Of the total
area of the country (14.3 million hectares [ha]), agricultural land accounts for
about 34 per cent (4.8 million ha), of which 82 per cent is pasture and hay
meadows. Individual households account for over 50 per cent of the country’s
agricultural production, and in some agricultural subsectors their contribution
reaches 80-90 per cent.
The poverty level has been declining over the last 15 years, reaching 36 per cent in
2013, with extreme poverty reduced to 14 per cent. Poverty is especially high in
rural areas, where the population depends mainly on agriculture, livestock and
remittances for livelihoods and food security. There are regional differences in the
poverty level, with the majority of poor people living in the Khatlon and Sughd
regions, which account for 65 per cent of Tajikistan’s total population. The
Government of Tajikistan has an ambitious plan to reduce poverty to 20 per cent by
2020. However, with the high annual population growth (3.8 per cent), lack of
employment and decreasing remittances, this target presents a challenge and
requires a strong commitment to, and advancement of, a wide range of reforms.
Tajikistan ranks lowest in Europe and Central Asia on gender equality, although
women are the main farmers in the country. Women’s status and position in society
have undergone a critical change since independence in 1991: they now have less
education, less formal employment and lower wages. Women head nearly half the
households that suffer from a heavy burden of food insecurity. Agriculture is their
largest employment sector – about 50 per cent of women were engaged in the
sector in 2010. However, their participation in agriculture is characterized by
seasonal and low-paid or unpaid positions. In the livestock sector, women are
mainly responsible for the care of animals within the homestead and undertake
much of the work of feed preparation, milking and cleaning.

RB-COSOP
Livestock ownership is a key coping strategy for the smallholder farmer in
Tajikistan. Livestock inventories have grown to levels higher than in the immediate
pre-independence period and livestock-raising is an activity in which nearly the
entire rural population engages. However, livestock-sector productivity is very low
and relies primarily on grazing, supplemented by limited cultivated feed crops and
minimal concentrates. The simultaneous rise in inventories and fall in feed supplies
mean that feed per animal has fallen dramatically, together with livestock
productivity.
The ability of livestock farmers to maximize the use of pastures is constrained by
many problems, including a lack of technical knowledge among small livestock
holders, poor governance arrangements on pasture management, inefficient
management of community livestock, shortage of feed during winter months,
environmental degradation, and lack of access to quality fodder seed and
infrastructure – all of which are further exacerbated by climate change. The project
will address these constraints in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of pasture
communities to the increasing threat posed by changing climate conditions. This
will ensure that livestock producer households maximize their returns, while
safeguarding the sustainable management of pastures. With the growing number of
livestock and further deterioration of natural pastures, a focus on pasture
management reforms resulted in the adoption of the Law on Pastures in March
2013. This law serves as a foundation for the pasture management decentralization
reforms that are being piloted in selected areas. However, experience has shown
that it is imperative to facilitate the reform process through further advancement of
the policy and legal framework for pasture management.
Improvement in livestock productivity would support poor households in dealing
with food security issues and would enhance their nutritional status. Despite the
relative decrease in poverty, many people are still poor and suffer from chronic
malnutrition. The most critical situation relates to the consumption of meat, eggs,
milk and dairy products. Investment in measures to overcome obstacles to
increased livestock productivity and production will have an immediate impact on
smallholders’ nutrition status, food security profile, income and livelihoods.
Increased livestock will also make a significant contribution to other agricultural
incomes through employment and productivity. IFAD is considered an ideal partner
to provide such support to farmers in the Khatlon region, given its experience in
working with smallholder farmers in Asia and in the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
Climate change adaptation interventions will address urgent environmental and
poverty issues. The close link between livestock productivity and rational and
efficient use of pastures requires a concurrent focus on the pasture/natural
resource management aspects of livestock production. This in turn requires an
effort to mainstream climate change adaptation in livestock and pasture
management, given that this sector is extremely vulnerable. Despite the fact that
the Khatlon region is among the areas most vulnerable to climate change and
disaster-related risk, the growing impact of climate change has not yet been
explicitly taken into account in the Livestock and Pasture Development Project
(LPDP). Thanks to the availability of ASAP financing, the urgent issue of climate
change adaptation has been integrated into both LPDP and the Livestock and
Pasture Development Project II (LPDP-II). In addition to experiences gained from
LPDP, the project also builds on past and ongoing experiences and policies of other
international agencies and major stakeholders, including the World Bank, Asian
Development Bank (AsDB), World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), German Agency for International
Cooperation (GIZ), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Aga Khan
2
EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
Foundation. During implementation, the project will actively seek synergies and
complementarities with these and other agencies involved in livestock/pasture
management and climate change and disaster risk reduction. The project has
established links with the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. This programme is
funded by the World Bank, AsDB, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) and the United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DFID) under the Strategic Climate Fund, which is one of two
multi-donor trust funds within the Climate Investment Funds.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
9.
LPDP-II will reach some 38,000 rural households in at least 200 communities in five
districts of the Khatlon region, which is located in the south-west of the country,
and has a population of 2.64 million or approximately one third of the country’s
total. It is divided into 25 districts, with a population ranging from 19,000 to
175,000 in each. LPDP-II will target households with the potential for increased
livestock productivity and high poverty level. Together, LPDP and LPDP-II target
35 per cent of the Khatlon region’s population, 35 per cent of its pastures,
43 per cent of large ruminants, 52 per cent of small ruminants and 30 per cent of
the area under fodder crops.
10. The project’s primary target group includes: (i) smallholder livestock households;
(ii) private veterinary service providers and small-scale entrepreneurs with the
potential to provide services to households and smallholder farmers; and
(iii) woman-headed households and women belonging to poor households. Target
group members will have a per capita income of less than US$2 per day, which is
currently the case for 50 per cent of the total population of Khatlon.
11. The project is taking the following approach: (i) geographical targeting to select
jamoats (administrative divisions) with the potential for livestock and pasture
development; (ii) selection of villages considering poverty data profiles;
(iii) household targeting for selection of households that meet the project’s poverty
and gender criteria; and (iv) gender targeting for the selection of women for
specific project activities through quotas for their inclusion. The project will
continue to emphasize the role of women in agricultural production and will make
concerted efforts to enable women to move beyond subsistence production and into
higher-value, market-oriented production.
B. Project’s development objective
12. The project’s development goal is to contribute to reduction of poverty in the
Khatlon region. The development objective is to increase the nutritional status and
incomes of some 38,000 poor households by enhancing livestock productivity and
climate resilience sustainably.
C. Components/outcomes
13. The project’s investments and activities will be implemented through three
components in addition to project management:
(a) Component 1: Institutional development. This component seeks to
enhance the capacity of targeted public-sector and community organizations
to be more effective and efficient at pro-poor pasture management
development. Two subcomponents are envisaged: (i) development of
community organizations; and (ii) advancement of policy and legal
frameworks and strengthening of national institutions.
(b) Component 2: Productivity enhancement and improved animal health.
The key objective of this component is to increase access to livestock and
veterinary services and fodder supply for smallholder producers (mainly
households), resulting in decreased mortality and increased productivity of
3
EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
sheep/goat flocks and cattle herds due to the reduced incidence and
prevalence of disease. Two subcomponents are envisaged: (i) enhancement of
livestock productivity; and (ii) improvement in animal health.
(c) Component 3: Pasture development and diversification for
vulnerability reduction. The key objective of this component is to increase
access to more productive and climate-resilient pasture areas as well as
diversified income-generating opportunities for livestock communities through
sustainable, community-led management of natural resources. The
participatory planning process will incorporate both climate-resilient pasture
management and animal production/health planning, thus linking the work to
be carried out under both the first and second components. This component
will strengthen the adaptive capacity, governance and management skills of
the Pasture Users’ Unions (PUUs) and their elected boards, reducing their
vulnerability to climatic stress. This will be done by building an understanding
within their constituent members of the importance of incorporating
climate-risk reduction measures within community livestock and pasture
management plans (CLPMPs) in order to ensure the long-term sustainability
and health of pastures and the restoration of pasture landscapes. These
measures will in turn improve livestock productivity and contribute to reduced
feed shortfall and income loss.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
14. The LPDP-II approach is based on community-driven development to enhance
adaptive capacity, reduce climate-induced risk and reduce poverty. Although LPDP
provides opportunities to enhance pasture management at community and national
levels, the growing impacts of climate change have not yet been explicitly taken
into account, especially in terms of development of the CLPMP and setting priorities
for wise, long-term investment in improving pastures. LPDP-II will address
integration of this urgent issue of climate change adaptation, thanks to the
availability of ASAP financing. LPDP and LPDP-II will be treated as one coherent
project in all operational aspects and will complement each other, specifically in
terms of the ‘one-project’ approach, implementation modalities and project
activities.
Organizational framework
B.
15. The Ministry of Agriculture will continue to have overall responsibility for
management of the project on behalf of the Government. A national project
steering committee (PSC) will continue to provide overall policy guidance for LPDP
and LPDP-II and maintain oversight of the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B).
The Deputy Minister responsible for the livestock sector will continue to chair the
PSC, which will review project progress and approve the AWP/B and annual
progress report.
16. The Ministry will develop policies and processes – jointly with the State Committee
for Land Management and Geodesy, and district hukumats (governments) – for
allocation of pasture land-use rights to the PUUs.
17. State Veterinary Inspection Services (SVIS) is a subdivision of the Ministry of
Agriculture and is responsible for the provision of veterinary services to farmers.
Under LPDP-II, SVIS will be responsible for: (i) providing data to the project
management unit (PMU); (ii) assisting in identification of jamoats, villages and
suitable veterinary candidates to participate in the strengthening of the private
veterinary services subcomponent; and (iii) working closely with the PMU and
community facilitators at the community level, particularly in ensuring that private
veterinarians can develop into an effective and financially sustainable service.

EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
C.
Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
18. The jamoats will approve the CLPMPs, which have been developed by the PUUs in
an inclusive and participatory manner and submitted to the PMU for review and
final approval. Based on the priority areas identified by the PUUs, community
facilitators and the PMU will develop a preliminary plan to be fed into the AWP/B.
The PMU will ensure that proposed activities are eligible for financing under the
project, and that proposed plans take into account the extent to which they are
realistic in terms of time frames and availability of resources. The PMU will prepare
draft AWP/Bs for each project year, to be submitted to the PSC for review and
approval. The PMU will submit semi-annual and annual progress reports to IFAD.
19. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will provide comprehensive
information for the project’s effective and efficient management and will help
stakeholders learn from implementation experience. Project impact will be
monitored by undertaking surveys at three stages during the life of the project:
baseline information at start-up, and impact evaluation at midterm and project
completion.
20. Knowledge generated by the project will be documented for dissemination to
regional and national audiences using a variety of instruments, including electronic
media, promotional meetings and workshops. LPDP-II will produce special policy
briefs, case profiles and case studies from its learning in the field.
Financial management, procurement and governance
D.
21. A financial management-capacity and risk assessment for this operation has been
completed in accordance with the guidelines of the Controller’s and Financial
Services Division. Overall, financial management risk is rated as medium. The latest
Transparency International indicator rating of 2.3 implies a high risk of corruption.
However, in the last few years, there has been good progress on, and strong
government commitment to, public financial management reforms. The project
design has some inherent financial management risks, given the substantial funds
earmarked for community-driven subprojects that are geographically widespread.
These risks will be mitigated somewhat by central PMU management of
procurement and payments for the subprojects. The proposed PMU, which is
currently managing the ongoing LPDP, has put in place financial accountability
systems and procedures that are functioning reasonably well. These will help keep
control risks at an acceptable level. The fiduciary performance of the current
portfolio is generally satisfactory, with the exception of an outstanding matter of
misprocurement in one project noted in 2010. While changes in project
management have subsequently been made to improve compliance with IFAD’s
procedures, the settlement of this case remains outstanding.
22. A number of measures are in place to assure good governance as indicated by
democratic accountability, transparency of financial management, gender
equitability and mechanisms for complaints and remedies, including: (i) consistent
stakeholder representation, through the PSC, in the project’s planning, monitoring,
evaluation and impact assessment cycle – affording mechanisms for complaints and
remedies; (ii) quotas for women beneficiaries; and (iii) application of guidelines and
procedures for procurement consistent with current IFAD Project Procurement
Guidelines. Specific actions needed to strengthen assurance of the correct use of
funds include: strengthening oversight measures for procurement and distribution
of goods, equipment and inputs to communities, based on approved subprojects;
introducing periodic internal audit reviews of operational controls to complement
external financial audits; adapting PMU accounting software for use in this project;
and hiring additional accounting staff. Appropriate covenants have been proposed
for these actions.

23.
Supervision
LPDP-II will be directly supervised by IFAD. One or two supervision and
implementation support missions will be organized each year, according to need.
IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
24. Total investment and incremental recurrent project costs, including physical and
price contingencies, are estimated at US$24 million (163 million Tajikistan somoni
[TJS] equivalent). Physical and price contingencies are low – at 3 per cent of total
project costs – due to investments associated with the various grants, representing
some 76 per cent of total project costs (expressed as a lump sum, with no
contingencies). The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$10.7 million or
about 44 per cent of total project costs. Taxes and duties make up approximately
US$0.45 million or 2 per cent of total project costs, and are mainly associated with
civil works and equipment and goods, which constitute some 15 per cent of total
costs. Project management expenses comprise about 6.7 per cent of total project
costs and are partly covered under LPDP.

B. Project financing
25. An IFAD loan of US$8.7 million (36 per cent of total project costs) will finance
47 per cent of the pasture development and diversification for vulnerability reduction
component. An IFAD grant of US$8.7 million (36 per cent of total project costs) will
finance: 71 per cent of the institutional development component (US$1.3 million), 83 per
cent of the productivity enhancement and improved animal health component (US$1.9
million), 22 per cent of the pasture development and diversification for vulnerability
reduction component (US$4.0 million), and 93 per cent of the project management
component (US$1.5 million). An ASAP grant of US$5.0 million (21 per cent of total
project costs) will finance 8 per cent of the institutional development component
(US$0.15 million) and 26 per cent of the pasture development and diversification for
vulnerability reduction component (US$4.8 million). The government contribution is
6
EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
estimated at US$0.45 million (2 per cent) and includes contributions from its budget
primarily to cover taxes (see next paragraph). Approximately US$1.4 million (5.6 per
cent) will be provided by beneficiaries as cofinancing of the CLPMP and other grants.
26. The government contribution will cover all taxes and duties on all project inputs
that involve funding from the IFAD loan/grant and ASAP grant or any other external
source of funding associated with the IFAD loan/grant and ASAP grant.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
27. The main project benefits will accrue to households in the 200 PUUs that constitute
the project area in the selected districts of the Khatlon region. Some 38,000
households will benefit directly and indirectly from the project’s interventions
(80 per cent of those targeted).
28. Economic analysis indicates that the project is robust in economic terms, yielding
an economic rate of return of 20 per cent and a net present value of US$8.6 million
taken over 20 years. The benefit stream (discounted at 12 per cent) is based on the
quantifiable benefits that relate directly to activities undertaken following
component implementation.
D. Sustainability
29. Through its design, the project will adopt a balanced approach between
environmental management, economic growth and strengthening of social capital.
A key focus of the project will be to promote policy supporting sustainable pasture
management, and to develop the adaptive capacity of PUUs to manage their
pasture areas better and sustainably, taking into account the predicted impacts of
climate change on pastures and pasture communities. PUUs with secure land-use
rights and empowered with technical knowledge and organizational skills will
continue to manage pastures on the ground.
7
EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
E. Risk identification and mitigation
30. Technical and climate risks associated with the project may lead to reduced
economic returns. Lack of capacity in governmental agencies and communities to
effectively participate in project activities may result in delayed realization of
benefits. The sensitivity analysis shows the project to be economically viable even if
benefits were to be decreased by 41 per cent or if the realization of benefits were
delayed by two years.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
31. The project is fully compliant with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2011-2015. The
design is further aligned with: (i) the new IFAD Environment and Natural Resource
Management Policy, which proposes greater attention to risk and resilience so as to
manage environmental and natural resource-related shocks, and promotes
livelihood diversification to reduce vulnerability and build resilience for sustainable
natural resource management; and (ii) the IFAD Climate Change Strategy.
Similarly, the design is fully compliant with the IFAD Policy on Targeting and the
Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment; and it adheres to the new
social, environmental and climate assessment procedures. LPDP-II is classified as
an environmental Category B project.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
32. The project is strongly aligned with, and contributes to, the priorities of the Third
National Communication of Tajikistan to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which identifies agriculture and livestock as being
particularly vulnerable to climate change. The project is also in line with the
Tajikistan National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation and the Tajikistan
Strategic Programme for Climate Resilience. The project will contribute to
integration of climate change adaptation considerations into the National
Development Strategy (NDS). The NDS already includes environmental
sustainability targets, a poverty reduction strategy explicitly mentioning climate
change issues, and the climate change adaptation strategy for the period 2015-
2030, which is being developed under the leadership of the State Agency for
Hydrometeorology.
Innovations and scaling up
C.
33. The ongoing LPDP has been a major intervention in the country in terms of
advancement of pasture management reforms and livestock-sector development.
Based on the experience and outcomes of the ongoing project, the Government has
decided to scale up its approach to additional areas with livestock development
potential. The established PMU – and the network of engaged institutions,
partnership arrangements and capacity and expertise accumulated in the project –
will facilitate smooth expansion of LPDP-II to the additional areas of the Khatlon
region.
D.
34.
Policy engagement
LPDP already plays a key role in the GIZ-facilitated Pasture Management
Networking Platform in Tajikistan, sharing its experience and lessons learned with
other practitioners and policymakers in that field. LPDP-II will continue to provide
assistance to formulation of a state policy and strategy for mainstreaming climate
change adaptation in sustainable pasture management, and to elaboration of legal
and regulatory documents to support implementation of the Law on Pastures,
including the development of a strategy for pasture management and improvement
for 2015-2020.

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements
I.
Project Description
1.
Target Population. The primary target group of the Project shall be the following:
(i) smallholder livestock households; (ii) private veterinary service providers and small
scale entrepreneurs with the potential to provide services to households and smallholder
farmers; and (iii) women-headed households and women belonging to poor households.
The Project is expected to reach approximately thirty-eight thousand (38 000) rural
households in the Khatlon region at a high poverty level with a potential for increased
livestock productivity.
2.
Goal and Objectives. The goal of the Project is to contribute to the reduction of
poverty in the Khatlon Oblast. The development objective is to increase the nutritional
status and incomes of the Target Population by enhancing livestock productivity and
climate resilience in a sustainable manner.
3.
Components. The Project shall consist of the following Components:
Component 1 – Institutional Development
3.1. This Component shall seek to enhance the capacity of targeted public sector and
Community Organizations (the “COs”) for more effective and efficient pro-poor pasture
management development. Component 1 shall be achieved through the following two
sub-components:
Sub-component 1.1: Development of COs. Under this sub-component, the PMU shall
select communities of a high level of poverty, but also recognized potential for livestock
development. Mobilization and strengthening of the Pasture Users’ Union (the “PUUs”)
will be conducted by Community Facilitators (the “CFs”) – non-governmental
organizations (“NGOs”) experienced in social mobilization of rural communities – backed
by the technical expertise and knowledge provided by the Project’s technical team. The
CFs shall facilitate the formation of the Common Interest Groups (the “CIGs”) among
eligible smallholder households interested in and capable of participating in livestock
development activities, and Self-help Women Groups (the “SWGs”) for income
diversification activities. They shall also assist the selected communities to undertake the
preparation and implementation of the Community Livestock and Pasture Management
Plans (the “CLPMPs”).
Sub-component 1.2: Advancement of Policy and Legal Framework and Strengthening
National Institutions. In order to ensure sustainability and advancement of pasture
management reforms, the Project, under sub-component 1.2, shall extend support to
institutional building, including that for the MOA. Technical guidance shall be provided for
future pasture development in developing policy and legislation to advance pasture
management transfer and monitoring pasture conditions, through assessing the quality of
pastures and monitoring the performance of PUUs. The Project shall provide assistance in
the formulation of a state policy and strategy for mainstreaming climate change
adaptation into sustainable pasture management, and the elaboration of legal and
regulatory documents to support the implementation of the Pasture Law. International
and local technical assistance shall be mobilized to provide assistance to review and
amend the Pasture Law.
5
Appendix I
EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
Component 2 – Productivity Enhancement and Improved Animal Health
3.2. The key objective of this Component is to increase access to livestock and
veterinary services, and fodder supply for smallholder producers, aiming at decreased
mortality and increased productivity of sheep/goat flocks and cattle herds. This
Component includes two (2) sub-components as follows:
Sub-component 2.1: Livestock Productivity Enhancement. Under this sub-component,
livestock farmers/households will be organized into groups for the provision of training in
improved animal husbandry and management practices, feed preparation and
identification of hygiene and health aspects. The CFs shall deliver the training programme
to the targeted communities. The sub-component shall promote fodder production and
distribution through the establishment of a Seed Fund. It shall strengthen private
entrepreneurs dealing with livestock input supply. Private sector participants dealing with
marketing of dairy, meat and other livestock products shall be provided with business
and technical assistance. The sub-component shall undertake an assessment of individual
entrepreneurs and identify their specific needs for business development, equipment,
credit and technical training. Business advisers recruited by the Project shall undertake a
broker role by providing such services and linking individual entrepreneurs with the
required service providers.
Sub-component 2.2: Improved Animal Health. Sub-component 2.2 shall support the
development of private veterinary services and the establishment of a private veterinary
network, which shall provide both animal health and artificial insemination services. A
facility shall be established under the sub-component, to which veterinarians selected to
serve the rural communities may submit applications for funding of veterinary drugs,
training, equipment, veterinary tools and veterinary clinics/centres. Based on its
experience of implementing this activity, the Project shall provide policy input on how the
existing policy on the establishment of these services at village level can be further
refined for more cost-effective use and a higher level of impact.
Component 3 – Pasture Development and Diversification for Vulnerability Reduction
3.3. The main objective of this Component is to increase access to more productive and
climate resilient pasture areas as well as to diversified income-generating opportunities
for livestock communities through a sustainable, community-led management of natural
resources. This Component is composed of two sub-components as follows:
Sub-component 3.1: Community Resilient Pasture Management and Investments. The
sub-component shall support PUUs in developing CLPMPs to address the degradation of
pasture resources, deterioration of pasture infrastructure, climate adaptation needs in
sustainable pasture management and restoration, winter feeding and livestock health and
production. Training and capacity building shall be provided to the PUU members to carry
out assessment and efficient planning, ensuring the active participation of the more
vulnerable households and involvement of women in planning and decision-making. The
sub-component shall build a monitoring and evaluation (“M&E”) system through
modelling of pasture productivity to determine carrying capacity and identify remote
pasture areas that could be accessed. Livestock-carrying capacity plans shall be based on
flexible carrying capacity estimates to continuously adapt the stocking rates to the highly
variable climatic conditions and biomass availability. These shall be done with support of
technical assistance, and shall be part of the CLPMPs. To support the initial
implementation of the CLPMPs, the Project shall provide investment grants through the
PUUs. The exact amount of each grant shall be linked to the PUU population and
performance of the PUU, including the collection of pasture use fees.
6
Appendix I
EB 2015/LOT/P.35/Rev.1
Sub-component 3.2: Income Diversification. This sub-component shall promote
alternative sources of income to diversify household economies. It shall explore income-
generating options beyond livestock to gradually reduce grazing pressure on pastures
and mitigate the impact of climate change. The sub-component shall provide financing to
encourage and nurture new economic activities through which the most vulnerable of the
rural society – mainly women – can build and develop additional sources of income as a
safety net against possible economic losses, to help build socio-economic resilience,
enhance their nutritional status and increase their incomes. This shall be coupled with
training and capacity enhancement activities for the identification, development and
management of new climate-resilient businesses. The sub-component shall provide
technical assistance, demand assessment, resource mapping, feasibility study and other
related studies by a professional Technical Facilitator prior to micro-project funding.

1 Public sector and community organizations are defined in Appendix 5 and PIM
2 Governance levels of PUUs will be assessed through a specific study. Governance will be measured through levels of (i) democratic accountability (qualitative: if elections of board or head
have been democratic), (ii) transparency of financial management (if members are informed of revenues and expenditures of PUUs); (iii) gender equitability (eg: presence of women’s sub-set
organizations / women’s groups within the VO). Source of information will be a annual survey, conducted by community facilitators, and mid-term / end of project HHs survey.
3 Technical capacity has been defined in LPDP, but needs to be further enhanced. Such level will be assessed when the project starts the interactions with the targeted organizations. Once
the parameters of technical capacities are agreed, the M&E Consultant will develop a list of aspects (similarly to what done for Governance levels), with help from the company developing the
MIS.
