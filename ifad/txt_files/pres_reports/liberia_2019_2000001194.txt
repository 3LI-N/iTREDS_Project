National context
The Republic of Liberia is home to approximately 4.2 million people, of which
47 per cent live in rural areas. Ninety per cent of the population is under 35 years
of age and 52.6 per cent is in the economically active age range (15 to 64 years).
Agriculture remains the mainstay of the country’s economy. In addition to large
commercial operations in the rubber and palm oil sector, Liberia’s family farms
produce rice, cassava and horticultural crops, mostly on a small, near-subsistence
scale. The sector employs around 70 per cent of the country’s labour force and
contributes 44.7 per cent of its GDP. A large proportion of the 600,000 hectares of
arable land available is unused. A range of structural challenges inhibit the sector’s
effective development, including a weak regulatory framework, poor infrastructure
and suboptimal performance of most agricultural value chains, reflected in low
yields and a lack of investment.
Liberia is among the countries with the lowest human development, ranked 181st
out of 189 countries in the world. In spite of significant GDP growth in the years
after the civil war, the economy is now stagnating, with 1.7 per cent growth in
2018 and a projected growth of only 0.4 per cent in 2019. The poverty rate
nationally is 50.9 per cent, while it stands at 71.6 per cent in the rural areas. Food
insecurity in the rural areas is 58.8 per cent, compared to the national average of
51.2 per cent. Thirty-five per cent of children under five years of age are stunted
and 69 per cent are anaemic.
Liberia is on the World Bank Group’s Harmonized List of Fragile Situations. It
remains a fragile country, due primarily to the prolonged civil war (1989 to 2003),
an epidemic of Ebola virus disease (2014 to 2015) and the limited capacity of
public administration.
Special aspects relating to IFAD’s corporate mainstreaming priorities
The Smallholder Agriculture Transformation and Agribusiness Revitalization Project
(STAR-P) proactively addresses the aspects of gender, youth, nutrition and
environment/climate change, and is consequently aligned with the Eleventh
Replenishment of IFAD's Resources (IFAD11) mainstreaming agenda and
transformational framework. Key project activities under each area include:
(a) Nutrition. Child undernutrition in all its forms (wasting, stunting and
underweight) is a major concern for Liberia, where 30 per cent of children
under five suffer from stunting and more than 500,000 are underweight. The
project will therefore promote nutrition through a variety of activities,
including the establishment of kitchen gardens for a subset of beneficiaries,
support to horticulture value chains to expand the supply of nutritious food in
the country, capacity-building in the Ministry of Agriculture and other
institutions, and information campaigns for rural families to grow and
purchase more nutritious food and increase dietary diversity.
(b) Gender. Women in Liberia suffer from low access to productive assets –
including land – and from uneven workloads at the household level. In
addition, the primary school completion rate for girls is only 47 per cent,
compared to 62 per cent for boys. The project will address key issues related
1
EB 2019/127/R.32
to gender imbalances, through capacity-building in communities and in the
public sector, in order to provide services to the rural poor with due
consideration for gender aspects. The value chains to be supported by the
project, particularly horticulture, have also been selected with a view to the
participation rate of women. The beneficiary groups will include at least
30 per cent women among their members.
(c) Youth. Youth, defined to be between the ages of 18 and 35, is
disproportionally affected by unemployment or informal employment,
especially in rural areas. The project will address this issue through the
establishment of quotas of at least 30 per cent for youth participation in
beneficiary groups, and priority access to matching grants for rural youth
entrepreneurs. In addition, the project will engage with the Government to
improve the overall business environment in agriculture, which is expected to
make the sector more attractive to youth.
(d) Climate change. Liberia is one of the countries in the world that is most
vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and variability. The
project will promote adaptation to climate change through a number of
measures such as: intercropping along the selected value chain, which will
increase crop diversification; the use of climate-resilient seeds; methods to
retain soil nutrients/prevent soil erosion; improved water management; and
integrated pest management.
Rationale for IFAD involvement
The project was approved by the World Bank in January. The financing agreement
for the International Development Association (IDA) credit entered into force in
late June 2019. The project will therefore be scaled up with IFAD financing.
The project is fully aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025 and the
priorities established in the IFAD11 Consultation, such as targeting the poorest
countries and fragile situations. It is also an example of IFAD’s renewed focus on
partnerships to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the
broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In addition to overall alignment with IFAD’s strategic vision, there is a strong
substantive rationale for engaging in the project: (i) the choices of vegetables, rice
and oil palm as targeted value chains have good poverty reduction potential and
are easy for smallholder farmers to adopt; (ii) the project helps ensure a concerted
approach to the full value chain, which is needed in the Liberian context; and
(iii) in a fragile situation like Liberia where IFAD has no country office, it is
particularly relevant to partner with other development institutions that have an
in-country presence, such as the World Bank.
IFAD’s value addition, which was agreed upon in the joint IFAD–World Bank
appraisal mission that took place in late 2018, includes the following: (i) the
vegetable value chain being reintroduced in the project; (ii) emphasis on support
to oil palm production being aligned with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil;
and (iii) sharpening of the poverty focus through a better definition of the target
group.
The World Bank's project appraisal document mentions the potential cofinancing
from IFAD and states that if it materializes in 2019, the Government is expected to
submit a restructuring request to reflect IFAD’s joint cofinancing of the total project
cost, which will lead to the issuance of a restructuring paper by the World Bank.
5.

10. However, the World Bank's project appraisal document does not reflect IFAD
cofinancing in the cost tables, economic and financial analysis, geographic
coverage and results framework targets – including in the number of beneficiaries
reached. Upon approval of the IFAD financing and on the formal request of the
Government, the World Bank will issue a restructuring paper that will indicate the
2
EB 2019/127/R.32
changes to the project with the inclusion of IFAD cofinancing. It has been agreed
that the restructuring paper will include, among other aspects: (i) updated cost
tables; (ii) increased geographic coverage from five to nine counties; (iii) an
update of the results framework to reflect increased outreach and nutritional focus;
and (iv) references to the kitchen garden pilot that was introduced for a subset of
the beneficiaries with the IFAD financing.
11.
Further refinements of technical details will be included in the project
implementation manual, which will be jointly validated to ensure that best practices
from both institutions are taken into consideration, particularly with regards to
targeting, smallholder focus, nutrition and land rights for youth and women.
12. An exchange of letters with the World Bank has been tabled at the session to
present the agreed way forward.
B. Lessons learned
13.
In fragile situations, proximity matters. Projects in the IFAD portfolio have
historically faced lengthy time lags from approval to first disbursement. The lesson
is that close follow-up and continuous support are needed after approval. One way
to address the issue is to work with a development partner such as the World Bank
with an in-country presence, able to provide close follow-up.
14. Value chains facilitating smallholder market linkages. While well-performing
tree crop value chains have traditionally benefited agribusiness firms, smallholder
farmers can also benefit. However, for smallholders to participate and obtain
higher value or a larger portion of the chain’s profits, the project will support them
in meeting the demands of other value chain actors such as processors, retailers
and exporters.
15. Without explicit targeting measures, woman-headed households and
youth may end up being left out of development processes. The integration
of youth and women in the economy is fundamental for Liberia’s development.
Without explicit efforts, youth and woman-headed households have limited access
to opportunities in areas in which adult men control community-level processes.
II. Project description
A. Project objectives, geographic area of intervention and target
groups
Project development objective
16. The project development objective is to increase agricultural productivity and
commercialization on the part of smallholder farmers for the vegetable, rice and oil
palm value chains in selected counties of Liberia. The geographic area will
indicatively consist of the following counties: Bomi, Gbarpolu, Grand Cape Mount,
Grand Gedeh, Lofa, Margibi, Maryland, Nimba and Sinoe.1
17. The direct beneficiaries of the project are approximately 38,000 smallholder
farmers, of whom at least 30 per cent will be women and young farmers.
Intermediate beneficiaries will include agribusinesses and business development
services enterprises that have business links to smallholder farmers in the targeted
value chains. Indirect beneficiaries include government staff in targeted ministries,
agencies, and commissions, and the private sector and other non-state institutions.
B. Components/outcomes and activities
18. The STAR-P will have three components: (i) institutional capacity-building and
strengthening the enabling environment for farmers and state and non-state
1 The original World Bank design only included Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, Lofa, Margibi and Nimba counties.
3
EB 2019/127/R.32
actors; (ii) enhancing productivity and competitiveness; and (iii) efficient project
management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and citizen engagement.
19. Component 1: Institutional capacity-building and strengthening the
enabling environment for farmers and state and non-state actors. This
component aims to provide training and strengthen the capacity of farmer-based
organizations (FBOs), and the institutional capacity of key public agencies and the
private sector to deliver the priority services necessary to promote competitive
commercial agriculture in Liberia. It will also finance studies with a view to
addressing selected policies or regulations that currently constrain growth in the
agrifood sector and particularly within the targeted value chains. The component
will have the following subcomponents:
Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening market-oriented smallholder farmer
groups for selected commodity value chains;
Subcomponent 1.2: Institutional strengthening for selected government
ministries, agencies, and commissions;
Subcomponent 1.3: Capacity-building for selected private sector and non-
state institutions; and
Subcomponent 1.4: Strengthening the enabling environment, policy,
regulations and administrative procedures for agribusiness development.
20. Component 2: Enhancing productivity and competitiveness: This component
aims at improving smallholders’ integration into the value chains targeted by the
project. The project will finance matching grants for smallholder farmers,
agribusinesses, business development service providers and financial institutions,
through establishment of the Liberia Agricultural Commercialization Fund (LACF) to
contribute to the costs of investment for the subprojects. Eligible expenditures will
include productive infrastructure, equipment, technical assistance and incremental
working capital. It will be implemented through the following subcomponents:
Subcomponent 2.1: Investment support for productive links between
smallholder farmers and agribusinesses;
Subcomponent 2.2: Support to agribusinesses and business development
service enterprises; and
Subcomponent 2.3: Support to financial institutions.
21. Component 3: Efficient project management, monitoring and evaluation,
and citizen engagement. This component is about management of the project,
including M&E and citizen engagement. It has the following subcomponents:
Subcomponent 3.1: Efficient project management and M&E;
Subcomponent 3.2: Effective communication and citizen engagement; and
Subcomponent 3.3: Contingency emergency response.2
C. Theory of change
22. The STAR-P will increase agricultural productivity and commercialization on the
part of smallholder farmers for selected value chains and counties in Liberia. It will
contribute to the higher-level objectives of making selected value chains more
efficient, commercialized and climate-resilient, which will contribute to improving
household and national food security and nutrition, reducing rural poverty and
improving shared prosperity.
2 This subcomponent will be financed solely by the World Bank.

23. To achieve higher productivity and increased sales of quality and climate-resilient
products by smallholder farmers, the project will implement activities that lead to
outcomes such as: (i) improved capacity of FBOs; (ii) the adoption by beneficiaries
of improved agricultural technologies; (iii) the establishment and improvement of
productive market links; and (iv) improved business environment, which will
enhance efficiency and performance along the value chain.
24. To achieve these outcomes, the project will: improve the capacities of FBOs, public
institutions, and non-state organizations; build awareness on constraints to an
enabling environment; support commercial partnerships between off-takers or
processors and FBOs; support proposals by agribusiness and small and
medium-sized enterprises for the delivery of upstream and downstream services –
such as for aggregation, warehousing, packaging, distribution or information and
communications technology; and support financial institutions through market
research and assessments.
D. Alignment, ownership, and partnerships
25. Within the context of the 2030 Agenda, the project aims to contribute substantively
to SDG 1 (No poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero hunger), through its focus on increasing
incomes and improving food security for smallholder producers.
26. The project is aligned with the Government’s development strategy, the Pro-Poor
Agenda for Prosperity and Development (PAPD) 2018-2023, which identifies the
agriculture sector as a major driver of economic growth and development. The
PAPD recognizes the importance of investing in the agriculture sector in order to
promote a structural transformation of the economy.
27.
Finally, the project is aligned with the IFAD country strategy note 2017-2019 for
the Republic of Liberia, which has two strategic objectives (SOs):
SO1: Smallholder farmers’ access to finance, inputs, skills and markets is
improved; and
SO2: Smallholders’ organizational capacities and access to Ministry of
Agriculture extension services are improved.
E. Costs, benefits and financing
28.
Project components 1 and 2 are partially counted as climate finance. The total
amount of IFAD climate finance for this project is preliminarily calculated at
US$6,519,575, which represents 28.4 per cent of the total IFAD project amount.
Project costs
29. Total combined project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at
US$61.9 million. Table 1 presents a breakdown of the costs by component and
subcomponent. It shows that component 1 (Institutional capacity-building and
strengthening the enabling environment for farmers and state and non-state
actors) represents US$9.3 million (15.1 per cent of total costs), while
component 2 (Enhancing productivity and competitiveness) accounts for
US$44.9 million (72.5 per cent of total costs), with US$7.7 million for component 3
(Efficient project management, monitoring and evaluation, and citizen
engagement) (12.4 per cent of total costs).

Project financing and cofinancing strategy and plan
30. STAR-P will be financed by an IDA credit of US$25 million, an IFAD financing
envelope of US$23 million (comprised of a highly concessional loan and a Debt
Sustainability Framework grant) and contributions of US$4.5 million from the
private sector and US$9.3 million from the direct beneficiaries. In accordance with
the World Bank’s country financing parameters and as an exception to the IFAD
General Conditions for Agricultural Development Financing, taxes can be financed
under the project, with no counterpart funds expected from the Government.
Disbursement
31. The funds will flow into a designated account denominated in US dollars in a
commercial bank in Liberia acceptable to the Fund. Separate designated accounts
will be opened for each financier to avoid co-mingling of funds as well as ease bank
reconciliations. With regards to the LACF, the Fund’s manager will be allowed to
operate an operational account to manage the matching grant scheme. STAR-P will
use the traditional methods of disbursement, which depend on the submission of
statements of expenditure to the World Bank and replenishment of project
accounts accordingly. The maximum authorized allocation will be determined for
the designated account so as to avoid liquidity problems.
32. Given that the World Bank will be designated as the cooperating institution, review
and authorization of withdrawal applications from the IFAD accounts will be
undertaken by it.
Summary of benefits and economic analysis
33. The project’s incremental benefits are estimated for a 20-year period by applying a
discount rate of 6 per cent to reflect the opportunity cost of capital. Under these
assumptions, the overall economic internal rate of return is 23 per cent. The net
present value is US$51.5 million. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the
robustness of these indicators against changes in key parameters.
Exit strategy and sustainability
34. STAR-P project formulation aims at ensuring the sustainability of activities and
benefits after project completion. The project’s exit strategy is therefore built into
the project design and is also reflected in the theory of change. Key elements of
the exit strategy include that:
(a)
(b)
(c)
The project aims at strengthening FBOs to enable them to collectively plan
production, purchase inputs and sell their goods through stable private sector
engagement;
The public sector will be strengthened with improved capacities to support
smallholder farmers and other value chain players. These improved capacities
will help enable the public sector to continue the support after project
closure; and
Through policy engagement, an improved policy framework more favourable
towards smallholder producers will enhance the sector’s opportunities in the
future and enable smallholders to continue to improve their socio-economic
situation after project closure.

III. Risks
A. Project risks and mitigation measures
35. The main risks and mitigation measures are as following:
Table 4
Risk
Risk
rating
Mitigation measures
Political/governance
High
Liberia is characterized as being fragile. A key political challenge is to eliminate
entrenched patterns of elite capture. Mitigation measures include independent
management of the LACF to ensure impartiality in financing matching grants.
Institutional capacity
Medium
Liberia’s weak institutional capacities limit the quality of its public service delivery.
The project will provide institutional capacity-building under subcomponent 1.2.
Fiduciary: financial
management
Fiduciary:
procurement
Environment and
climate
Medium
Medium
Medium
The capacity and implementation readiness for financial planning are recognized
as significant weaknesses in Liberia and need to be closely monitored.
Procurement officers will be competitively recruited, with capacity-building and
support provided upon request, and supervision and checks undertaken regularly.
Mainstreaming of climate change mitigation and adaptation practices will be
undertaken. No large-scale oil palm plantations will be established.
B. Environment and social category
36. World Bank safeguards procedures will apply to the project. The following
documents have been developed: (i) Environmental and Social Management
Framework; (ii) Pest Management Plan; and (iii) Resettlement Policy Framework.
37. Some large-scale oil palm plantations have received criticism for unsustainable
practices. The STAR-P will only finance smallholder plantations; no subproject with
any potential adverse environmental or social impacts will be financed. It should
also be noted that the oil palm is native to West Africa and that palm oil is an
integral part of the local cuisine. The project is identified as category B.
C. Climate risk classification
38. Safeguards against climate vulnerabilities are built into the project activities,
notably in the rice value chain – including the introduction of improved production
techniques and lowland rehabilitation – and in the oil palm value chain, including a
focus on the rehabilitation/replanting of plantations rather than expanding to new,
currently forested areas. A climate risk assessment has been undertaken by the
World Bank.
D. Debt sustainability
39. The risk of debt distress for Liberia is considered to be moderate, with total debt
stock accounting for 25 per cent of GDP, composed mostly of multilateral loans.
However, Liberia remains a fragile country, vulnerable to external shocks.
Moreover, the outcomes of the last consultation and surveillance mission from the
International Monetary Fund in 2019 noted negative economic and financial trends
that could eventually impact Liberia’s ability to meet its external obligations.
IV. Implementation
A. Organizational framework
Project management and coordination
40. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established within the existing project
management unit under the Ministry of Agriculture, to implement the project in
partnership with this ministry and its county officials.
41. The responsibilities of the PIU will include: project planning and management;
financial management; procurement; M&E; communication and knowledge
management; supervision of project activities; facilitating linkage with
9
EB 2019/127/R.32
governmental, private sector and development partner institutions; and integrating
project experience into policy engagement.
Financial management, procurement and governance
42. Financial management. A financial management assessment was conducted for
the project, in accordance with the World Bank directive. Given that the project
management unit is currently managing the fiduciary functions for World Bank- and
IFAD-financed projects, the project will build on past financial management
arrangements in World Bank-financed projects, which are assessed as adequate for
ensuring: (i) that the funds are used only for the intended purposes and in an
efficient and economical way; (ii) the preparation of accurate, reliable, and timely
periodic financial reports; (iii) the safeguarding of the project's assets; and
(iv) that fiduciary assurances are provided through an independent audit of the
project. The control risk is assessed as moderate. The overall residual financial
management risk for the project is assessed as high, but is reduced to moderate
because of the articulated measures for risk mitigation and external auditing by the
Government's General Auditing Commission.
43. World Bank and IFAD funds will be executed according to a pari passu arrangement
that will be established in the restructured IDA financing agreement and the IFAD
financing agreement. The pari passu shall tentatively be 48 per cent for IFAD and
52 per cent for the World Bank.
44. Procurement. The recipient will carry out procurement under the project in
accordance with the World Bank’s procurement regulations, and will adhere to the
Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed
by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants, and to other provisions stipulated in
the financing agreements. The project will use the World Bank’s Systematic
Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement, an online tool for the planning and tracking
of all procurement transactions.
45. Governance. A steering committee will be established, and will include
representatives of the relevant ministries and agencies, public and private sector
institutions, non-state actors, and youth and women’s organizations. It will be
chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture.
B. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge
management and communication
46. The project will build on the PIU M&E systems set up under past World Bank
projects. An initial assessment of the PIU M&E capacities highlighted the need for
staff training and the use of software packages to improve M&E efficiency. Among
other capacity-building initiatives, staff will be trained through the IFAD-initiated
Programme in Rural M&E, which aims to enhance staff capacity to monitor and
report on project results.
47. The project’s logical framework will be the main tool for supporting results-based
monitoring, reporting and learning. While the World Bank results framework will be
used, parallel reporting will be undertaken to IFAD’s Operational Results
Management System. Knowledge management will be integrated into the M&E
system.
48.
Innovation and scaling up
Innovation. The project will facilitate the provision of services by oil palm
concessions to neighbouring communities, by including these communities in
outgrower schemes. In addition, in order to mitigate the risk of outside
interference in the decisions of the matching grant scheme, the project aims to
provide matching grants through a professionally managed fund – a novelty in the
country.
10
EB 2019/127/R.32
49. Scaling up. The project builds on and will bring to scale the approaches of
previous World Bank and IFAD projects,3 which supported smallholder FBOs in
productivity growth and market linkages in the tree crop and rice value chains. The
STAR-P will work with existing FBOs established under these projects. There will be
ample opportunity to scale up the project at a later stage, by using the LACF model
for matching grants in other geographic areas or in other value chains.
C.
Implementation plans
Implementation readiness and start-up plans
50. The IDA credit financing agreement became effective in late June; the recruitment
of staff for the PIU is under way. Project start-up is therefore imminent. Execution
of IFAD funds is not expected to encounter delays once the IFAD financing has
become effective. The restructuring of the project following the approval of IFAD
funds is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2019, in the context of
which IFAD and the World Bank will jointly update the project implementation
manual.
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans
51. The World Bank and IFAD will conduct joint supervision and implementation
support to enhance the project’s impact. A midterm review will be conducted
halfway into the project implementation period, with a completion report to be
prepared after the project completion date.
V. Legal instruments and authority
52. A STAR-P financing agreement between the Republic of Liberia and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
recipient.
53. The Republic of Liberia is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.
54.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VI. Recommendation
55.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan for an amount of sixteen
million seven hundred ninety thousand United States dollars
(US$16,790,000) and a Debt Sustainability Framework grant for an amount
of six million two hundred and ten thousand United States dollars
(US$6,210,000) to the Republic of Liberia and upon such terms and
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.
