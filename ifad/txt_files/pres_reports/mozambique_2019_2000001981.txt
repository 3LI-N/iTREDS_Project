Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation contained in 
paragraph 60. 
I.  Context 
A.  National context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
1. 
National context 
The Republic of Mozambique’s landscape bears scars from the 16-year civil war 
(1977-1992), which left the country and its economy in ruins. Owing to the 
impressive economic performance from 1993 to 2014, Mozambique’s poverty level 
fell from 69.7 per cent in 1996 to 46.1 per cent in 2015. Poverty remains higher in 
rural areas, however, and significant inequalities persist.  
2.  Mozambique’s total population is estimated at 28.9 million, with 70 per cent living 
in rural areas. The country has a rapidly growing young population (45 per cent of 
children were under 14 in 2017). Malnutrition is a concern, with a 43 per cent 
prevalence of child stunting.  
3.  Mozambique experienced annual economic growth of over 7 per cent until 2014, 
sustained largely by public investment in infrastructure. The country’s economic 
growth has, however, been negatively impacted, mainly by the debt crisis. By 
2016, debt represented over 90 per cent of Mozambique’s GDP and the country 
continues to struggle with the debt burden.  
4.  Mozambique is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change – it is ranked the 
third most vulnerable country in Africa, with climate change impacting 58 per cent 
of the population. This was evidenced in March-May 2019 when the country was hit 
by tropical cyclones Idai and Kenneth, which destroyed hundreds of thousands of 
hectares of cropland in central and northern Mozambique. 
5.  Only 10 per cent of Mozambique’s 36 million hectares of arable land and 2 per cent 
of its irrigation potential is currently being utilized. There are several national 
plans/strategies/policies in place that aim to facilitate gains or improvement in 
smallholder agriculture performance, rural poverty reduction and enhanced food 
security. The most important one is the National Agricultural Investment Plan. 
6. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD’s corporate mainstreaming priorities 
Climate change. Mozambique is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events. 
The country’s vulnerability is exacerbated by its limited adaptive capacity, growing 
population and dependence on the natural resource base. Droughts and floods are 
common extreme events and pose the highest threat to smallholder farmers’ 
natural resource base. The Inclusive Agrifood Value Chain Development 
Programme (PROCAVA) has been designed and will be implemented in compliance 
with IFAD’s Climate Change Strategy; Environment and Natural Resources 
Management Policy; and Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment 
Procedures.  
7.  Gender and Social Inclusion. Mozambique’s Gender Development Index of 
0.904 is low. Women have lower literacy levels and female heads of household are 
more likely to have no formal education. PROCAVA is aligned with IFAD’s Policy on 
Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment and its Gender Action Plan  
2019-2025. 
8. 
Youth. While the youth labour force is increasing by almost 40 per cent per annum, 
the rate at which new formal sector jobs are being created remains static. 
PROCAVA will address rural youth issues, in line with IFAD’s Rural Youth Action 
Plan 2019-2021. 
1 
EB 2019/128/R.26/Rev.1 
9.  Nutrition. Mozambique continues to depend on food imports to satisfy a large 
portion of its domestic needs, particularly for edible oils and staple food crops. In 
2017, food imports accounted for 29 per cent of the country’s import bill. From a 
nutrition perspective, PROCAVA is aligned with the Mainstreaming Nutrition in IFAD 
Action Plan 2019-2025.  
10. 
In line with Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD11) mainstreaming 
commitments, the programme has been classified as:  
☒ Climate-focused; 
☒ Youth-sensitive. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
11.  Mozambique’s demand for agricultural products is expanding, but current 
production is inadequate to meet prevailing demand levels. Measures are thus 
required to replace widespread unsustainable land management and agricultural 
practices with climate-resilient land management and agricultural production 
systems. The IFAD-funded Pro-Poor Value Chain Development Project in the 
Maputo and Limpopo Corridors (PROSUL) already initiated this process in selected 
districts in the southern region, wherein there have been achievements in 
developing select value chains and promoting good agricultural and livestock 
practices. These successful interventions will be scaled up in the PROCAVA target 
areas. With new agricultural technologies, there is also need to prepare rural areas 
for more off-farm entrepreneurship. Hence, PROCAVA will build locally based value-
adding into the target value chains, using appropriate climate-smart and 
environmentally sustainable technologies and practices.  
B.  Lessons learned 
12.  A number of relevant lessons have been learned either from IFAD’s country 
portfolio of ongoing and completed projects or from the Government’s and other 
development partners’ interventions. PROCAVA’s design is also informed by lessons 
and recommendations from the Independent Office of Evaluation of IFAD.1 A 
summary of selected lessons is provided below. 
13.  Participatory approach. A participatory design process is considered to be 
important for ensuring ownership of the programme by the beneficiary 
stakeholders from the very beginning. For PROCAVA, the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Food Security (MASA) ensured a comprehensive consultative process that 
involved various stakeholders at local, district and provincial levels. 
14.  Economic infrastructure. Economic infrastructure developed within a value chain 
programme should address bottlenecks that have been identified as limiting along 
the value chain. For PROCAVA, the target economic infrastructure should be 
established in a timely manner. 
15.  Nutrition education. Experience from the nutrition promotion component of the 
IFAD/European Union-funded Millennium Development Goal 1.C (MDG1c) 
programme demonstrated that nutrition education as a stand-alone activity has 
limited impact, since improving nutrition requires multisectoral action. Under 
PROCAVA, nutrition-related interventions will address issues related to awareness, 
access, availability and affordability of nutrient-rich foods. 
16.  Capacity-building for target group. Implementation experience has 
demonstrated that it is beneficial for capacity-building and training activities for 
household groups to be conducted within communities in order to encourage 
participation. 
17.  Capacity-building for project staff and lead implementing agency (LIA). 
PROSUL faced challenges in recruitment of adequate staff, interpretation of 
important documents, preparation of a bottom-up annual work plan and budget, 
1See the Mozambique Country Strategy and Programme Evaluation (CSPE), February 2017. 
2 
EB 2019/128/R.26/Rev.1 
and appropriate procurement processes. A well-structured introductory training 
programme will be developed and given to the PROCAVA management and LIA 
staff. 
18.  Use of private sector service providers. PROSUL’s experience with the use of 
private sector service providers yielded both positive and negative results. Some of 
the positives included: (i) provision of expertise that is lacking or not readily 
available in the public sector and (ii) more time available to project management 
and the LIA to focus on overseeing project implementation and guidance.  
19.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. An effective M&E function requires a 
simple but practical M&E system and the provision of training to all concerned 
stakeholders. This experience has been taken into account in planning for 
PROCAVA monitoring and evaluation. 
20.  Enabling environment for agricultural commercialization. Implementation of 
the Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion Programme in Zambia demonstrated that 
promotion of agriculture commercialization without an enabling environment leads 
to limited achievement of desired outcomes. 
II.  Programme description 
A.  Objectives, geographical area of intervention and target 
groups 
21.  Programme goal and objective. PROCAVA, with a financing approach of five 
years, will be implemented within a 10-year programmatic framework to provide 
the necessary instruments to attract other development partners to work with IFAD 
as and when they are ready. This approach will also provide potential cofinanciers 
with an opportunity to pick geographical areas for their focus or investment. The 
programme’s goal is to contribute to poverty reduction, improved food and 
nutrition security and resilient livelihoods for inclusive rural transformation. The 
development objective is to increase net incomes from climate-resilient agrifood 
value chains for rural women, men and youth. The programme will target the 
following value chains: (i) selected horticulture commodities under irrigation; 
(ii) red meat (cattle and goats); (iii) poultry; (iv) cassava; and (v) legumes.  
22.  Geographical area of intervention. PROCAVA will be implemented in 
75 districts, selected from all 10 provinces of Mozambique, in two phases over the 
10-year framework. To enhance effectiveness, value chains will be prioritized in 
those provinces where they have a clear comparative advantage. Activity 
implementation will follow a phased approach. 
23.  Target groups. PROCAVA will target a total of 180,500 households 
(902,500 beneficiaries); 50 per cent of that target number will be women and 
30 per cent youth. The quotas for women and youth are based on national 
demographics and poverty lines for those two categories of population and on 
lessons learned from PROSUL. 
24. 
In order to reach the intended beneficiaries and guard against elite capture, 
PROCAVA will use selected targeting mechanisms, including direct targeting and 
self-targeting, supported by empowering and enabling measures. 
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
25.  The programme will have the following components: 
 
Component 1: Production improvement and market linkages. This 
component is intended to improve the production and productivity of target 
crop and livestock commodities. It will improve backward and forward 
linkages of farmers to different stakeholders in the target value chains. 
Strengthening climate resilience and enhancing natural resource management 
and environmental sustainability, through promotion of appropriate



technologies and best practices, will also be an integral part of this 
component.  
Component 2: Market-related climate-resilient infrastructure. This 
component aims to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure is in place to 
support the effectiveness of market-led production interventions and to more 
efficiently deliver the surplus production to different markets. Planned 
interventions will focus on addressing constraints faced by relevant actors 
operating within target value chains. This will include supporting rural 
infrastructure investments that can add value at the location, upgrade the 
performance of enterprises and enable associated agricultural producers to 
become competitive and environmentally and profitably sustainable. 
Infrastructure will be prioritized according to business plans and linkages 
along the value chain. 
Component 3: Institutional and policy strengthening and 
implementation support. This is a cross-cutting component supporting the 
technical components and facilitating pathways for the effective functioning of 
the target value chains. 
Component 4: Disaster risk reduction and management. This 
component has been included as mechanism for enabling IFAD to respond 
urgently in the event of weather-related calamities (droughts, floods or 
cyclones) in the country. The work under this component is expected to 
facilitate and expedite the implementation of level-2 project restructuring in 
the event of an emergency or disaster.  
26.  There are three expected outcomes: (i) productivity, production and quality of 
targeted value chains improved – PROCAVA is expected to increase the productivity 
and production of the five targeted value chains; (ii) market access and 
performance of targeted value chains improved – the implementation of PROCAVA 
interventions is expected to link the target beneficiaries’ increased production to 
different marketing channels and result in improved returns to the beneficiaries; 
and (iii) institutional capacity to deliver services enhanced. 
C.  Theory of change 
27.  PROCAVA’s theory of change envisages a three-pillar approach contributing to the 
target beneficiaries’ food, nutrition and income security by improving the economic 
surplus generated by the value chains. The first pillar presents market 
opportunities for target beneficiaries to engage in more efficient production and 
processing activities. However, the beneficiaries are faced with a number of 
constraints at different points along the value chains. These constraints limit the 
effectiveness of the targeted value chains. The second pillar (de-risking/risk-
sharing) will seek to address the most constraining factors to enable the target 
beneficiaries to participate more effectively at different points on the value chain 
and in a manner that rewards them (returns to investment). While PROCAVA may 
have the means to directly contribute to addressing some of the limiting factors, 
other factors will require collaboration with other stakeholders. The third pillar will 
therefore aim to promote such collaboration. 
D.  Alignment, ownership, and partnerships 
28.  PROCAVA will contribute to several of the Sustainable Development Goals linked to 
IFAD results: SDG1, on poverty; SDG2, on hunger and food; SDG5, on gender 
inequality; and SDG14, on conservation and sustainable use of aquatic resources.  
29.  PROCAVA’s design is aligned with national priorities for strengthening the 
agricultural sector to move towards a commercial orientation, underpinned by the 
strong involvement of smallholder farmers.  
30.  PROCAVA’s design and implementation arrangements will contribute to the 
achievement of the three core objectives of IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-
2025. The programme will also contribute to the fulfilment of key IFAD11 
4 
EB 2019/128/R.26/Rev.1 
commitments: 2.2, increase focus on the poorest and most vulnerable people 
within each country; 3.3, mainstream the key cross-cutting themes of nutrition, 
gender, youth and climate; and 3.5, make strategic partnerships for financing, 
knowledge, advocacy and global influence a cornerstone of IFAD operations. The 
programme is in compliance with the Social, Environmental and Climate 
Assessment Procedures approved in 2017. IFAD’s policy to preventing and 
responding to sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse will be taken into 
account during implementation. 
31.  The programme will coordinate, harmonize and establish partnerships with projects 
financed by IFAD, the Government and various development partners that support 
PROCAVA-related thematic areas. 
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
32.  Programme component 2 (market-related climate-resilient infrastructure) is 
partially counted as climate finance. The total amount of IFAD climate finance for 
this programme is preliminarily calculated as US$19.6 million, representing 
47 per cent of IFAD’s total investment.  
Programme costs 
33.  Total programme costs, including price and physical contingencies, duties and 
taxes, are estimated at US$72.5 million. Of this amount, US$30.8 million is foreign 
exchange content and around US$7.2 million relates to duties and taxes. 
Programme costs by component are as follows: (i) component 1: production 
improvement and market linkages – US$26.4 million); (ii) component 2: market-
related climate-resilient infrastructure – US$29.2 million; and (iii) component 3: 
institutional and policy strengthening and implementation support – 
US$16.9 million.

Financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
34.  PROCAVA will be financed by an IFAD loan (US$8.4 million) on highly concessional 
terms and an IFAD grant (US$33.6 million) under IFAD11. The project will also be 
financed by the Government of Mozambique (US$4.9 million) and project 
beneficiaries (US$5.6 million). The GCF has also expressed an interest in financing 
PROCAVA (US$20 million grant). The IFAD financing is provided in United States 
dollars. The IFAD loan and grant will finance expenses inclusive of taxes. 
6 
EB 2019/128/R.26/Rev.1 
35.  The Government will cover the salaries of its own staff, who will support project 
implementation on a prorated basis.  
Disbursement 
36.  The IFAD financing is envisaged to cover 58 per cent of the total programme costs, 
of which civil works will account for 39 per cent and equipment and materials for 
21 per cent. Operating expenses have been calculated at 10 per cent, while 
salaries will absorb 15.8 per cent of the total funds. Although the use of 
government systems that meet the minimum standards will be encouraged, 
PROCAVA will be required to use an accounting package to facilitate reporting in 
the formats required, an area not yet supported by the government Financial 
Administration System [Sistema de Administração Financeira do Estado]  
(e-SISTAFE). A designated account will be opened with the Bank of Mozambique to 
receive funds, which will flow through e-SISTAFE to the government line ministry 
and then be allocated to the PMU. At provincial level, funds will be disbursed to the 
MASA single treasury account for the programme. Start-up funds will flow out of e-
SISTAFE to get the programme off the ground quickly. All major programme 
payments will be centralized at the PMU level. The funds will be disbursed to the 
programme under the imprest account replenishment procedure. 
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
37.  PROCAVA’s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 
16.7 per cent. The economic net present value (ENPV) is 7,372.9 million 
Mozambican meticals, or US$122.9 million, at a 10 per cent social discount rate. As 
the ENPV is positive and the EIRR is higher than the social discount rate, PROCAVA 
is deemed economically viable and acceptable for investment. 
38.  Financial benefits will be seen in terms of increased farm productivity and 
increased financial returns to the households targeted by PROCAVA. Social benefits 
will include a reduction in poverty rates in the targeted PROCAVA areas, with 
special measures taken to ensure the inclusion of disadvantaged groups. This will 
be an effect of the increased financial returns to households as a result of 
participation in the various programme interventions. 
39.  The sensitivity analysis shows that a reduction of programme benefits of up to 
20 per cent would not jeopardize PROCAVA’s economic viability. An increase of 
programme costs of up to 30 per cent would not seriously affect the programme’s 
economic viability, since the ENPV would remain positive and the EIRR well above 
the social discount rate. 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
40.  PROCAVA implementation is to be completely immersed within the Government’s 
institutional, strategy and policy framework; this integration will continue to exist 
after programme completion, and institutional capacity will have been considerably 
strengthened. In addition, the participatory design process will ensure that 
PROCAVA responds directly to target beneficiaries’ concerns. This will provide the 
foundation and necessary commitment for post-PROCAVA continuity. In addition, 
qualifying stakeholders will be linked to available financing options, including the 
IFAD-funded Rural Enterprise and Financing Project, to enable them to access 
different financial products on offer. 
III.  Risks 
A.  Programme risks and mitigation measures 
41.  The following institutional, economic, social and environmental risks and relevant 
mitigation measures were identified in the PROCAVA design process.

Peace deal signed between the Government and the 
Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) in August 
2019. Presidential, parliamentary and provincial 
elections should take place in October 2019. 
Economy is still under stress notably due to high level of 
public debt. Government is implementing robust 
measures to ensure economic stabilization, which is 
already showing positive results. 
Several existing national strategies and policies aim to 
facilitate improvement in smallholder agriculture 
performance, rural poverty reduction and enhanced food 
security. The most important one is the National 
Agricultural Investment Plan. 
A significant portion of the PROCAVA budget is targeted 
at institutional strengthening. 
PROCAVA will focus on ensuring effective 
implementation progress to minimize this risk. 
  Constant monitoring of the macroeconomic 
environment to ascertain whether foreign currency 
rates and devaluation of local currency (inflation) will 
affect purchasing power and in turn implementation. 
  A stand-alone accounting package to be procured to 
ensure timely accounting and financial reporting.  
  Payments to be centralized through the PMU account 
for large purchases.

through its procurement plan. 
PROCAVA’s climate risk mitigation strategy is guided by 
its Environmental and Social Management Framework. 
Extensive stakeholder consultations took place 
throughout the design of PROCAVA in the targeted ten 
provinces. 
  Awareness-raising on weather-indexed insurance 
policy. 
Implementation of disaster risk reduction measures. 
 
  Capacity-building in climate risk management and 
climate vulnerability analysis. 
  Built-in flexibility to reallocate resources. 
  Seamless transition between PROSUL and 
PROCAVA. 
  Prequalification and registration system for service 
providers. 
B.  Environment and social category 
42.  PROCAVA’s environmental and social categorization is A. PROCAVA will develop 
and/or rehabilitate irrigation schemes, some of which will be larger than 100 ha per 
scheme. These schemes are likely to pose a risk of significant and/or adverse 
environmental and social impacts. Environmental and social impact assessments 
will therefore be carried out and environmental and social management plans and 
monitoring plans will be developed to mitigate risks associated with these category 
A schemes. The rest of the proposed programme interventions are expected to 
pose medium-level risks to the environment and social system. These risks will be 
localized, manageable and/or reversible through recommended mitigation 
measures.  
C.  Climate risk classification 
43.  PROCAVA’s climate risk classification is “high”, and a detailed climate risk analysis 
was therefore carried out, as required. Programme investments will focus on crops 
8 
EB 2019/128/R.26/Rev.1 
and livestock systems that are sensitive to climate change and project measures 
will be required to reduce vulnerability. 
D.  Debt sustainability  
44.  Mozambique’s public debt continues to be at high distress levels, as noted in the 
International Monetary Fund’s country report of May 2019. The authorities are 
pursuing a strategy to bring this level down to moderate. The public and publicly 
guaranteed debt, including domestic debt, amounted to about 110.5 per cent of 
GDP as of the end of 2018. The exchange rate for imported items could pose 
potential risks for the programme, but this risk is mitigated by the fact that 
PROCAVA will be able to maintain and transact for imports in the currency in which 
it will receive the loan and grant – either United States dollars or Euros. The 
situation will, however, need to be monitored closely for any local currency 
inflationary effects on local prices that could affect the level of programme 
implementation.  
IV.  Implementation 
A.  Organizational framework 
Programme management and coordination 
45.  MASA will be the lead executing agency and will be responsible for overseeing 
PROCAVA implementation.  
46.  A national project management unit (NPMU), based in Maputo, will be established 
under the direct supervision of FDA’s Director-General. The NPMU will be 
responsible for PROCAVA’s day-to-day management and supervision under the 
leadership of a national programme coordinator. Given PROCAVA’s geographical 
spread, programme management will be organized into sub-units, with 
responsibilities delegated to regional programme management units and provincial 
programme management units in order to adequately cover PROCAVA’s target 
geographical regions. 
Financial management, procurement and governance  
47.  Financial Management (FM). Although, given the country context, the project is 
assessed with a high inherent risk, the anticipated FM risk is deemed to be medium 
thanks to the mitigation measures to be implemented. FM will be mainstreamed 
within government systems, as with other, ongoing projects. The assessment 
undertaken established that these systems have the potential to provide adequate 
controls and ensure proper management of programme funds; this will be 
continuously reviewed during implementation. The programme will, however, adopt 
the use of an off-the-shelf accounting package to mitigate the reporting challenges 
envisaged with the government system, while at the same time continuous 
discussions will take place on possible improvements to e-SISTAFE. Project 
planning and budgeting will be aligned with the government calendar.  
48.  Audit. PROCAVA will be audited by the Office of the Auditor General of 
Mozambique. The audit will be conducted in accordance with the International 
Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions and will be in compliance with the IFAD 
requirements for project audits.  
49.  Procurement. The existing legal framework for public procurement in Mozambique 
is currently governed by decree 5/2016, which establishes the principles and 
procedures to be applied in any procurement by public authorities and institutions 
governed by public law, under public control or using public funds. 
50.  Governance. Programme governance will be led by the national programme 
steering committee as the programme’s governing body. While primary 
responsibility for the enforcement of good governance rests with the Government 
of Mozambique, all project stakeholders will be made aware that IFAD applies a 
zero-tolerance policy towards fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive actions in 
IFAD-financed programmes. 
9 
EB 2019/128/R.26/Rev.1 
B.  Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning, knowledge 
management and communications 
51.  PROCAVA’s results-based logical framework will be the foundation for the 
programme’s M&E system. The NPMU will be responsible for M&E, which will be 
undertaken at various levels to support effective implementation, maintain the 
programme’s focus and direction, provide information for addressing constraints 
and ensuring delivery of outputs and outcomes. PROCAVA’s M&E system will be 
supported by an online Open Data Kit-based monitoring system, to be developed 
and installed at the regional and national levels. 
Innovation and scaling up 
52.  PROCAVA will demonstrate basic processing and value addition for selected 
horticulture commodities through the construction of small-scale vegetable 
packaging houses at selected irrigation schemes. Similarly, PROCAVA will facilitate 
the setting-up of pen fattening centres for cattle and goats close to abattoirs, and 
various pen fattening management models will be piloted and scaled up. The 
programme will also focus on scaling up successful results and technologies 
developed, tested and proven under PROSUL. 
C.  Implementation plans 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
53.  To ensure implementation readiness at start-up, a draft annual work plan and 
budget, procurement plan and project implementation manual have been prepared 
as part of the design for PROCAVA. In addition, part of the PROSUL staff will be 
integrated into PROCAVA’s PMUs, based on satisfactory performance evaluation. 
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans 
54.  Supervision. IFAD and the Government will jointly supervise PROCAVA.  
55.  Midterm review. A joint IFAD-Government midterm review will be undertaken in 
year three. 
56.  Programme completion review. A review will be carried out to evaluate 
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability and potential for scaling 
up PROCAVA. The findings will inform the design of the next phase of programme 
interventions. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
57.  A programme financing agreement between the Republic of Mozambique and IFAD 
will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as 
appendix I.  
58.  The Republic of Mozambique is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 
IFAD. 
59. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

Schedule 1 
Programme Description and Implementation Arrangements 
I. 
Programme Description 
1. 
Target Population. PROCAVA will target a total of around 180,500 households: 50% of 
that  target  will  be  women,  and  30%  youth.  PROCAVA's  primary  target  group  will  be 
smallholder  farmers  comprising  the  poor,  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  rural  households 
involved  in  the  selected  value  chains.  PROCAVA  will  pay  particular  attention  to  women 
heading households while ensuring that women in men headed households are not left out. 
Programme area. PROCAVA will be implemented in 75 districts selected from all ten 
2. 
provinces of the country over the entire ten-year period and in two phases. 
3.   Goal.  PROCAVA’s  Goal  is  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  improved  food  and 
nutrition security and resilient livelihoods for inclusive rural transformation. 
4.  Objectives.  The  Objective  is  to  increase  the  net  incomes  from  Climate-Resilient 
Agri-Food value chains by rural women, men and youth. 
5. 
Components.  
Component  1.  Production  Improvement  and  Market  Linkages:  This  component  aims  at 
contributing  to  improve  production  and  productivity  of  target  crop  and  livestock 
commodities.  It  will  also  improve  backward  and  forward  linkages  of  farmers  to  different 
stakeholders of the target value chains. Proposed interventions will seek to address some of 
the identified constraints to increased productivity and production of the target value chains 
and the associated market linkages. Strengthening climate resilience and enhancing natural 
resource management and  environmental sustainability through promotion of appropriate 
technologies and best practices will be an integral part of this component. 
Component  2.  Market-Related  Climate  Resilient  Infrastructure:  The  objective  of  this 
component  is  to  avail  the  appropriate  infrastructure  to  support  the  effectiveness  of  the 
market-led production interventions and to more efficiently deliver the surplus production to 
different  markets.  Planned  interventions  will  focus  on  addressing  constraints  faced  by 
relevant  actors  operating  within  target  value  chains.  This  will  include  supporting  rural 
infrastructure  investments  that  can  add  value  at  the  location,  upgrade  performance  of 
enterprises  and  support  associated  agricultural  producers  to  become  competitive, 
environmentally  and  profitably  sustainable.  Infrastructure  will  be  prioritized  according  to 
business plans and linkages along the value chain. 
Component 3. Institutional and Policy Strengthening and Implementation Support: This will 
be a cross-cutting component servicing the technical components and facilitating pathways 
for  the  effective  functioning  of  the  target  value  chains.  Accordingly,  it  will  aim  at:  (a) 
augmenting  the  capacity  of  the  institutions  that  will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  and/or 
implementing  the  different  PROCAVA  activities;  (b)  facilitating  the  development  and/or 
review  and update  of policies and  strategies  of selected  subsectors for their effective and 
structured development; and (c) managing PROCAVA in an efficient and effective manner by 
providing  overall  coordination, 
financial 
management  and  control,  procurement  support,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  knowledge 
management, and progress reporting. It will also ensure liaison and linkage with all other 
relevant  programmes  being  implemented  in  the  country  that  seek  to  address  similar  or 
related constraints. 
including  planning  and 
implementation,

II. 
Implementation Arrangements 
6.  
Lead Programme Agency. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) or 
the  Ministry  that  will  be  in  charge  of  Agriculture  during  the  implementation  of  the 
Programme, will be the lead executing agency.  
7.   Programme  Oversight  Committee.  MASA  will  establish  a  National  Programme 
Steering Committee (NPSC) to serve as the governing body of the Programme. The PSC 
shall be chaired by the Minister of MASA and composed of members from institutions with 
direct relevance to the achievement of PROCAVA’s goal and development objective. 
8. 
Regional Programme Consultative Groups. Regional Programme Consultative Groups 
(RPCGs)  would  be  progressively  set  up  in  each  of  the  three  regions  of  the  country 
(Southern, Central and Northern) following PROCAVA’s phasing approach. 
9. 
Provincial  Programme  Consultative  Group.  In  addition  to  the  three  RPCGs,  a 
Provincial Programme Consultative Group (PPCG) will be set up in Niassa Province since it 
will be having a separate Programme Management Unit. 
10.   Programme  Management  Unit  (PMU).  A  National  Programme  Management  Unit 
(NPMU)  will  be  established  under  the  direct  supervision  of  Fundo  de  Desenvolvimento 
Agrário  (FDA)  Director  General;  it  will  be  based  in  Maputo.  NPMU  will  be  charged  with 
responsibility of the day to day management and supervision of the Programme, under the 
leadership of a National Programme Coordinator (NPC); the NPC will report to the Director 
General  of  FDA.  Given  the  geographical  spread  of  the  Programme,  Programme 
management  will  be  organised  into  sub-units  (Regional  Programme  Management  Units 
(RPMUs))  and  Provincial  Programme  Management  Unit  (PPMU)  to  adequately  cover 
PROCAVA’s target geographical regions. Three RPMUs and one PPMU will be, progressively, 
established following the Programme’s implementation phasing approach.  
11.   Implementing  partners.  MASA  will  also  liaise  and  work  with  other  Ministries  and 
partners whose mandates have a direct bearing on the achievement of the PROCAVA goal 
and development objective.  
12.   Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E).  The  NPMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall 
Programme  monitoring  and  evaluation.  M&E  will  be  undertaken  at  different  levels  to 
support effective implementation, maintain the Programme’s focus and direction, provide 
information for addressing constraints as well as ensure delivery of outputs and outcomes. 
IFAD will undertake periodic monitoring, evaluation and supervision Missions to assess the 
status of Programme implementation and evaluate the Programme’s direction with respect 
to its objectives, outputs and Outcomes. A baseline study will be undertaken during the 
first year of Programme implementation to provide a benchmark for assessment of future 
outcomes and impact of the Programme. The PROCAVA M&E strategy will be to establish 
an  iterative  process  for  identifying  issues  and  problems  to  ensure  that  the  Programme 
focus is maintained and expected outcomes are achieved. 
13.   Knowledge  Management  (KM).  Knowledge  Management  will  be  an  integral  part  of 
PROCAVA to ensure that Programme implementation is a continuous learning process in 
which  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  will  be  compiled,  analysed  and  disseminated  as 
lessons  learned.  PROCAVA’s  M&E  system  will  form  the  foundation  of  KM  and  learning 
system and will, thus, be a primary instrument of information capture and storage, based 
on  the  indicators  detailed  in  the  results  framework.  The  Knowledge  Management  and 
Learning Officer at the NPMU will lead and coordinate all KM activities in close liaison with 
the M&E Officer, Regional M&E Officer, Provincial M&E Assistant and the value chain leads. 
Collaboration with relevant universities, research and learning institutions to design and
