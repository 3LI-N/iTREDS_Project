Recommendation for approval 
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed 
financing to the Government of Uttarakhand, India for the Rural Enterprise 
Acceleration Project (REAP), as contained in paragraph 53. 
I.  Context 
A.  State and national context and rationale for IFAD involvement 
State and national context. India has made substantial progress over the period 
1. 
2005-20162 in halving the many dimensions of poverty which translates into over 
270 million fewer poor. However, the country still has the world’s highest number 
of people living in poverty (364 million), a situation that has worsened due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and requires continued and increased efforts to sustain 
previous gains. 
2. 
3. 
The State of Uttarakhand in northern India has a GDP of 2.5 trillion Indian rupees 
(US$34 billion) (2018/19). In 2015 domestic product grew at an annual rate of 
37.4 per cent but has since declined to 10.4 per cent (2019). Uttarakhand has two 
administrative divisions and 13 districts, with 10 located in hill areas and three in 
lowland regions. Around half of the population lives off agriculture, although 
cultivable areas make up less than 15 per cent of the land.  
The state and central governments have rolled out several policies to tackle the 
challenge of unemployment. The state envisages a huge scope for cluster-based 
enterprise development in agriculture and other sectors to ensure higher incomes 
for rural communities. The recently completed Integrated Livelihoods Support 
Programme (ILSP), a flagship programme of the Government of Uttarakhand’s, 
made a positive impact on the welfare and livelihoods of the state’s poor. The 
Government of Uttarakhand is keen that key elements of the programme are 
replicated elsewhere in the state.  
4. 
Special aspects relating to IFAD's corporate mainstreaming priorities 
In line with the Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD's Resources mainstreaming 
commitments, the project has been validated as: 
☒ including climate finance; and 
☒ youth-sensitive. 
5.  Gender and social inclusion. India ranks 95th out of 129 countries in the Gender 
Development Index (GDI). In Uttarakhand, the GDI improved from 0.457 in 
1996 to 0.647 in 2006, reflecting an overall improvement in gender relations. Two 
critical challenges, however, remain for women – a high annual per capita earning 
gap and high levels of drudgery. Due to widespread economic migration from rural 
areas by men, women continue to shoulder the main burden of caring for their 
families.  
6. 
7. 
Youth. Young people account for almost a third of India's population. A large 
number of unskilled youth in Uttarakhand –and in the country in general – migrate 
in search of better employment. This trend is predominant in the hill districts of the 
state. Migration is both seasonal and long-term owing to a lack of local jobs. 
Despite the state’s strong economic growth rate, an increasing number of job 
seekers have not been able to access productive and remunerative work.  
Climate and environment. Projections indicate continued intensification of 
climate change and variability, resulting in increased extreme weather events such 
as droughts, floods and natural disasters. This will exacerbate soil erosion in the 
mountainous areas of the state, where many of the rural poor rely on natural 
2 Measured by the Multidimensional Poverty Index. 
1 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
resources and rainfed agriculture. The promotion of cluster-based production 
focusing on low volumes, high value, environmentally sustainable and 
climate-resilient value chains is an appropriate, climate-smart approach for the 
state’s development, with potential for building climate resilience across wider 
geographical areas. 
8.  Nutrition. Uttarakhand has made significant improvements in its nutritional status 
over the past two decades. However, despite diminished rates of stunting and 
underweight, child malnutrition remains a problem, as does anaemia among 
women. The crops and value chains being promoted under REAP are 
nutrition-sensitive, and value chain promotion will focus on enhancing both 
household consumption of nutrition-dense crops and generating a marketable 
surplus. Additionally, the project will develop strategies for addressing malnutrition 
among children and women through institutional partnerships, especially with 
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS).  
9. 
Rationale for IFAD involvement 
The rationale for IFAD’s involvement in the state lies in the potential to: (i) harness 
the strength of institutions created through the previous, IFAD-supported 
ILSP project and create self-sustaining institutions driving livelihoods 
transformation in the state; (ii) build on the existing strong partnership with the 
State Government, especially the Uttarakhand State Rural Livelihood Mission 
(USRLM), to transfer lessons from ILSP and other projects to scale up good 
practices across the state; and (iii) leverage knowledge and expertise to contribute 
to the Government of Uttarakhand’s efforts to move from subsistence agriculture 
and livelihood models to value chains and enterprise promotion models that have a 
long-lasting impact on the local economy and on migration, while also reducing 
vulnerability to climate shocks. 
10.  REAP’s cluster-based approach is being followed as part of a national strategy to 
establish farmer producer organizations (FPOs) to ensure volume and quality of 
consolidated value chain products. The approach is widely recognized as essential 
to aggregate production, ensure economies of scale and develop formal 
cooperatives or FPOs that could act as agents of change. Clustering in this form 
provides attractive benefits for farmers by concentrating rural services in particular 
areas and making them available to broad networks of farmers. The aim is to lower 
transaction costs, and foster improved efficiency in market transactions, plus 
greater productive flexibility. 
11.  The Government of India recently announced several important agricultural 
reforms, with which the goals and objectives of REAP are aligned. REAP’s 
intervention framework is in line with the two agricultural reform bills and the 
Union Budget announcement. These include: (i) promotion and nurturing of 
10,000 FPOs (Union Budget 2019-2020); (ii) the Farmers’ Produce Trade and 
Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; and the Farmers’ (Empowerment 
and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. The 
aim of this legislation is to increase marketing options for farmers, enhance their 
bargaining power, enable competitive price discovery for agricultural produce and 
raise farm incomes. 
12. 
IFAD has extensive and successful experience working with small-scale farmers in 
the promotion of anti-poverty and climate-smart value chains in India and 
elsewhere. It is able to leverage global and technical expertise on value chains and 
“market-first” approaches to strengthen capacities in the state. IFAD has, 
moreover, been fully committed to Government of India’s strategic goal of doubling 
farmers’ incomes, and this is reflected in the India Country Strategic Opportunities 
Programme (COSOP) (2018-2024).  
2 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
B.  Lessons learned 
13.  The following points summarize the key lessons learned from various 
IFAD-supported projects in India and the subregion, as well as lessons collected 
from civil society in the country. These include the need for: (i) leveraging 
government resources through convergence;3 (ii) leveraging community 
institutions as vehicles to deliver government interventions in remote areas; (iii) a 
market-first approach to production on a cluster basis to sustainably increase 
farmers’ incomes; (iv) grassroots institutional development is essential to success 
in commercializing smallholder agriculture; and (v) empowerment of women is key 
to sustainable family well-being. 
II.  Project description 
A.  Project objectives, geographic area of intervention and target 
groups 
14.  The goal of REAP is to contribute to doubling the incomes of rural households and 
reduce distress migration from rural areas. The development objective is to build 
resilience in rural households by diversifying their sources of income through 
intensified, cluster-based, climate-resilient production systems from selected value 
chains. Also aimed for is the promotion of on- and off-farm enterprises and the 
development of a supportive ecosystem. Farm enterprise intensification will be 
achieved through support to community groups and their federated structures to 
promote cluster-based production through apposite value chains, based on market 
demand.  
15.  The project will build on the work done by the ILSP in 44 community development 
blocks (CDBs) in 11 districts, as well as by the USRLM, which is being implemented 
in all 95 CDBs across all 13 districts. 
16.  The total expected outreach of the project will be 560,000 households 
i.e. 2.7 million individuals, largely comprising small farmers and landless 
households, including returnee migrants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
the target households, some 60 per cent of participants will be women and 
35 per cent youth. The majority of the beneficiaries are small farmers (with less 
than 1.0 ha), livestock raisers, microentrepreneurs, non-farm producers, workers 
in service sectors, agricultural labourers and people engaged in other activities.   
17.  There will be three categories of smallholders – extremely poor,4 poor, and 
commercially oriented. Among all beneficiaries, 80 per cent will be from the first 
two categories, each with 40 per cent, while the remaining 20 per cent will be from 
the third. REAP will also target 10,000 ultra-poor households, to be supported 
through a separate package.  
B.  Components, outcomes and activities 
18.  The project will pursue its objective by working towards three major outcomes: 
(i) agricultural production of rural households intensified and farm, off-farm and 
non-farm enterprise promoted, with employment opportunities created; 
(ii) capacity for community-based organizations (CBOs) and partnerships 
strengthened; and (iii) conducive enterprise promotion ecosystem fostered. 
19.  Component 1: Inclusive cluster development. The component will be 
implemented through two subcomponents. Subcomponent 1.1: livelihoods 
diversification and enterprise development; and subcomponent 1.2: institutional 
strengthening of CBOs and partnerships. The objective of subcomponent 1.1 is to

households. The project implementing authority leads the process by establishing strong partnerships with concerned line 
departments. 
4 The extreme poor groups including single women, women-headed households, people with disabilities, landless, agricultural 
labourers, schedule castes (SCs) and schedule tribes (STs). 
3 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
build the capabilities of individual farm households, self-help groups and producer 
groups to diversify livelihoods opportunities. The objective of subcomponent 1.2 is 
to strengthen the capacity of CBOs to increase their outreach to households and to 
develop into viable, inclusive farmer institutions. 
20.  Component 2: Ecosystem for enterprise development. The component will be 
implemented through two subcomponents. Subcomponent 2.1: strengthening 
support services and market infrastructure. The aim here is to develop the enabling 
conditions for livelihoods, enterprise and value chain development by establishing 
last-mile market infrastructure, providing support services and scaling up a youth 
incubation scheme. The objective of subcomponent 2.2 is to support project 
activities by facilitating access to financial services. 
21.  Component 3: Project management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and 
knowledge management. A project management unit (PMU) will be established 
at both state and district levels. The state-level PMU will be led by a Project 
Director and at district level by District Project Managers in all 13 districts. The 
PMU will converge with government programmes and projects that will actively 
support project implementation both technically and financially. A high-powered 
committee will provide strategic oversight.  
C.  Theory of change 
22.  The theory of change identifies two principal factors behind the persistently high 
levels of rural poverty: (i) traditional agriculture systems that are subject to the 
risks and impacts of climate change, leading to low productivity, inadequate 
volumes of marketable products and low profitability; and (ii) lack of a conducive 
environment for farm commercialization and enterprise development, with limited 
investment in support services that promote better living standards, particularly in 
the rural hill areas. 
23.  The project will facilitate a combination of efficient production technology, practices 
and methods to reduce workload. Considering the challenges of remunerative job 
opportunities for young men and women in the state, and the level of distress 
migration, the project intends to create both short- and long-term opportunities for 
youth. These will include developing a cadre of agricultural entrepreneurs and 
service providers responsible for last-mile service delivery. To address the vagaries 
of climate change, the project will converge with the interventions of the 
Department of Agriculture and Department of Watershed Development in the 
Government of Uttarakhand’s, which will build on ILSP activities related to 
watershed development. REAP will further feature components related to soil and 
water conservation and address climate change challenges directly through climate 
adaptation interventions. Finally, a conducive enabling environment will ensure a 
steady stream of innovative and entrepreneurial youth and migrants interested in 
engaging in farm and off-farm activities. These efforts are expected to contribute to 
doubling the income of rural households and reducing distress emigration. 
D.  Alignment, ownership and partnerships 
24.  REAP contributes to the achievement of four Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs), in particular: SDG 1 (no poverty); SDG 2 (zero hunger); SDG 5 (gender 
equality); and SDG 13 (climate action). REAP is similarly aligned with the 
Government’s Strategy for New India for development, contributing directly to its 
drivers for rural transformation. The strategy foresees doubling farmers’ incomes, 
modernizing agriculture, and value chain and rural infrastructure development. 
25.  At corporate level, the project is aligned with IFAD policies for mainstreaming 
nutrition, gender, youth and climate. The project objectives and activities are well 
aligned with the single, focused strategic objective of COSOP 2018-2024, namely 
that “smallholder food and agricultural production systems are remunerative, 
4 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
sustainable and resilient”, which contributes to the 2018-2022 United Nations 
Sustainable Development Framework for India. 
26.  REAP will converge with other ongoing government initiatives, especially with those 
of the Department of Rural Development and the various line departments, as well 
as the Uttarakhand Parvatiya Aajeevika Sanvardhan Company (UPASAC5) and 
commercial banks to facilitate loans to self-help groups and household farm 
enterprises. To address the vagaries of climate change, REAP will converge with 
the projects of the State Watershed Development Programme and the Department 
of Agriculture, which will build on ILSP activities related to watershed development 
while also intervening in soil and water conservation. Partnership will also be 
forged with the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority as well as the 
ICDS for expanding the supply of highly nutritious, ready-to-eat food prepared by 
livelihood collectives (LCs). 
E.  Costs, benefits and financing 
Project costs 
27.  Total project costs are US$378 million over seven years. The total amount of 
IFAD climate finance for this project is calculated at US$17.7 million, which is 
approximately 17 per cent of the US$105 million of IFAD financing (of which 
US$44.83 million derives from funds cancelled from previous performance-based 
allocation system cycles in line with IFAD’s restructuring policy).

EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
Project financing and cofinancing strategy and plan 
28.  The project is cofinanced by the State Government of Uttarakhand, various 
government programmes (under convergence), UPASAC, banks, project 
beneficiaries who include FPOs/LCs, and the private sector. The ratio of IFAD loan 
resources to all cofinancing is 1:2.6. 
29.  Funds will flow from IFAD through the Government of India into the state’s 
consolidated fund for reimbursement of prefinanced expenditures. 
30.  Retroactive financing. As an exception to section 4.07(a)(ii) of the General 
Conditions of IFAD, the Fund is seeking Executive Board approval for retroactive 
financing of up to US$1 million to cover eligible expenditures by start-ups between 
August 6, 2021 and the date of entry into force. To be eligible for retroactive 
financing, goods and services must have been procured according to the 
procurement procedures applicable to loan financing. Retroactive financing needs 
to be prefinanced by the Government and reimbursed after the agreement with 
IFAD has entered into force and the conditions governing withdrawal have been 
met. 
Disbursement 
31.  A designated account in United States dollars for the loan will be opened by the 
Government of India at the Reserve Bank of India, to receive funds from IFAD on a 
reimbursement basis. The financing from IFAD will be in United States dollars. The 
Government of India will transfer IFAD funds to the Government of Uttarakhand, 
which in turn will release this amount to the project in accordance with the 
approved annual workplan and budget (AWP/B). Thereafter, reimbursements from 
IFAD can be claimed through claims and withdrawal applications. Disbursements 
from the PMU will be made to the other implementing partners as per the AWP/B 
and to the district project management units (DPMUs). Funds from the DPMUs will 
be disbursed to the cluster-level federations (CLFs), LCs and communities for 
project activities. The PMU and DPMUs will obtain utilization certificates from the 
implementing partners and the CLFs, LCs and community organizations for each 
quarter, based on which further releases shall be made. 
Summary of benefits and economic analysis 
32.  The direct project benefits stem mainly from: (i) increased farm incomes after 
adoption of new technologies; (ii) income generated by new value chain 
enterprises established with project support;(iii) incremental income of producers 
supplying raw materials to enterprises; and (iv) added revenue for FPOs and 
LCs who start a business with project support. The financial viability indicators 
show that all of the enterprise models are financially viable. The financial internal 
rate of return of the whole project is 26 per cent, with a net present value of 
US$759 million. The adjusted cash flows of the project yield an economic internal 
rates of return (EIRR) of 31 per cent, with an economic net present value of 
US$1,034 million. The results of the sensitivity analyses showed that if costs 
increase by 10 or 20 per cent, benefits decrease by the same amounts. Both 
scenarios yield EIRRs that are higher than the opportunity cost of capital, 
suggesting that the farm and enterprise models are quite stable in the face of risky 
scenarios. 
33.  The project also generates several indirect benefits, namely (i) enhanced financial 
and social service delivery by the FPO and LCs to their members; (ii) food and 
nutrition security in the project area; (iii) improved animal health (dairy, poultry, 
goat, sheep, and fisheries); (iv) value chain development through improved market 
access; and (v) expansion of rural businesses.

EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
Exit strategy and sustainability 
34.  REAP will ensure institutional sustainability and effectiveness through dedicated 
support to CBOs to establish them as independent economic entities and actors. 
REAP has been designed in consultation with, and involvement of, the relevant 
government agencies, technical line departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
potential beneficiaries. These consultations and discussions have resulted in a 
sound approach and a suite of interventions that will be implemented with strong 
community and group participation, and the engagement of local officials. Building 
on this foundation, it is expected that the investments and the results of the 
interventions will be sustained well beyond the project period.

B.  Environment and social category 
35.  The environmental and social category assigned to REAP is B. Potential 
environmental and social risks and impacts are site-specific and limited to 
production (land development and use of agrochemicals), agroprocessing facilities 
(solid waste and effluent management with possible threats to the health and 
safety of workers), and potential impacts from construction of small-scale storage 
facilities and warehouses. Potential adverse risks and impacts will be readily 
mitigated and/or considerably reduced with known and cost-effective, site-specific 
mitigation measures that include promoting climate-smart agricultural practices 
and natural resource-based livelihood options. 
C.  Climate risk classification 
36.  The climate risk classification for REAP is high. The project is located in areas where 
rural development initiatives have experienced significant weather-related losses 
and damage. Floods have impacted roads, bridges and irrigation schemes, and 
changes in rainfall quantity and intensity are expected to result in higher surface 
runoff, leading to flash floods, soil erosion, soil nutrient loss, decreased aquifer 
recharge and landslides, particularly in mountainous or hilly areas.  
D.  Debt sustainability  
37. 
India’s debt-to-GDP ratio of 69.6 per cent is well above peer emerging markets. 
The latest World Bank/International Monetary Fund debt sustainability analysis of 
India considers the risk of external debt distress and overall debt distress to be 
low. The size of India’s external debt has increased since 2017-2018, but remained 
at around 20 per cent of GDP. While the increase in external debt was largely due 
to borrowing by non-government actors, the share of short-term debt (on residual 
maturity basis) in total debt increased since 2017-2018, driven by non-resident 
deposits, commercial borrowings, and short-term trade credit. India’s external 
9 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
vulnerability, in terms of reserve adequacy indicators, remains low compared to 
earlier years. 
38.  Real GDP growth is, however, projected to increase over the period 2022-2026 by 
an average of 6.6 per cent annually, driven by agriculture and manufacturing. 
Stronger external demand and foreign direct investment, an easing of trade 
tensions and improved global financial conditions could support growth and 
facilitate adjustments.  
IV.  Implementation 
A.   Organizational framework 
Project management and coordination 
39.  The lead executing agency will be the Department of Rural Development, which will 
implement REAP in cooperation with various other departments. The organizational 
structure is on four levels – state, Uttarakhand Gramya Vikas Society (UGVS), 
district and block. The project will be implemented through the PMU headed by a 
project director reporting to the chief project director and assisted by a core team. 
District-level implementation teams will be housed with the DPMUs to be 
established in each of the 13 project districts. At the block level the project team 
will be integrated with the USRLM operations. 
40.  A Technical Advisory Panel comprising senior experts of public and private agencies 
will be appointed to provide technical advice and guidance to the Project 
Management Committee (PMC). Much of project staffing will be outsourced to 
service providers.  
Financial management, procurement and governance  
41.  Financial management (FM). FM arrangements reflect lessons learned from 
ongoing IFAD-supported projects. FM arrangements will be mainstreamed into the 
state’s planning and budgeting processes. The state’s online treasury management 
system and the national public FM system will be used for allocation of project 
funds, application of internal checks and controls, accounting and financial 
reporting, and tracking of project unspent bank balances. Based on IFAD’s 
assessment, proposed FM arrangements are acceptable and provide reasonable 
assurance that loan proceeds will be used for intended purposes and properly 
accounted for. With agreed supplemental measures in place, the residual FM risk is 
rated as moderate. 
42.  Procurement. Primary responsibility for procurement and its management under 
REAP will be with the lead project agency, UGVS and the lead department under 
the Government of Uttarakhand. While discharging this primary responsibility, 
UGVS is to mandatorily observe the provisions of the revised IFAD Policy on 
Preventing Fraud and Corruption in its Activities and Operations, its policy to 
preventing and responding to sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and abuse, its 
Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Policy, and its 
Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures. 
43.  Governance. Under IFAD's policy on fraud and corruption, the independent and 
competent authority responsible for receiving, reviewing and investigating 
allegations of fraud and corruption should be nominated by the Government of 
Uttarakhand and confirmed to IFAD in writing (prior to loan negotiations), while 
any further changes/revisions to the nominated authority should be notified too. 
B.  Planning, M&E, learning, knowledge management and 
communication 
44.  The PMU will be responsible for preparing the AWP/B and procurement plan for 
REAP, and for securing approval from its management and IFAD. The plan will 
include an activities plan along with targets and an expenditure plan, and should 
10 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1 
reflect overall project targets and activities. An effective M&E system will be 
developed to cover the indicators in the logical framework.  
45.  The REAP M&E system will be built on a very robust structure instituted by 
ILSP and seen as a good-practice model. The system will be used as a 
management tool and will include an assessment of progress and compliance, and 
identification of constraints and proposed remedial actions. The project’s knowledge 
management activities will support an effective flow of relevant information among 
project staff, beneficiaries and other stakeholders. Output, outcome and impact 
data generated by the M&E system will inform case studies, briefs and reports. 
These will be used for policy dialogue, peer learning and potential scaling up. 
Knowledge management products will be communicated through multiple media, 
including blogs, written publications, videos and social media. 
Innovation and scaling up 
46.  An Innovation Fund of over US$5 million for pioneering start-ups has been included 
in project design. The project will also pilot some innovative features that include: 
(i) digital education, development of start-ups; (ii) new, sustainable land 
management measures; and (iii) youth incubation pilot testing through the rural 
business incubator model and/or alternative local entrepreneurship initiatives 
proposed for testing under REAP.  
C.  Implementation plans 
47. 
Implementation readiness and start-up plans 
IFAD and the government have identified the key actions to ensure implementation 
readiness. This includes: (i) recruitment of core staff; (ii) establishment of a 
management consultant facility; (iii) mapping and capacity appraisal of technical 
agency support/partner implementation organizations; (iv) conducting a baseline 
survey of the project area combined with a livelihoods analysis; (v) reviewing and 
evaluating of the performance of LCs and FPOs; (vi) assessing demand and supply 
for local service providers; (vii) conducting detailed analyses of priority value 
chains at block level; and (viii) preparing financial analyses of target enterprises.  
48.  To facilitate start-up, the PMC will recruit a project expeditor – a person who was 
previously involved in project design– to support establishing the project 
management structure and system.  
49. 
Supervision, midterm review and completion plans 
IFAD will conduct regular supervision according to standard procedures. 
Supervision missions will review project performance, progress towards 
achievement of objectives and compliance with fiduciary requirements. REAP will 
submit biannual progress reports using a format pre-approved by IFAD. 
V.  Legal instruments and authority 
50.  A project financing agreement between the Republic of India and IFAD will 
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as 
appendix I. 
51.  The Republic of India is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.  
52. 
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 
11

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements 
I. 
Project Description 
1. 
Target  Population.  The  Project  shall  benefit  560,000  households  i.e.  2.7  million 
individuals  largely  comprising  small  farmers  and  landless  households.  Of  the  target 
number  of  households  some  60%  will  be  women  and  35%  youth.  The  majority  of  the 
beneficiaries are small farmers (with less than 1.0 ha. of land), livestock growers, micro 
entrepreneurs, non-farm producers, workers in service sectors, agricultural labourers and 
those who are engaged in other income generating activities. 
2. 
Project  area.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  all  the  13  districts  and  in  all 
95 Community Development Blocks (CDBs) of Uttarakhand. The Project will build on the 
work  done  through  the  Integrated  Livelihoods  Support  Programme  (ILSP)  in  44 
Community Development Blocks (CDBs) in 11 districts as well as the Uttarakhand State 
Rural Livelihood Mission (USRLM) which is being implemented in all 95 CDBs across all 13 
districts. (“The Project Area”) 
Goal.  The  goal  of  the  Project  to  contribute  to  the  doubling  of  income  of  rural 
3. 
households and reduce distress rural out migration. 
4. 
Objectives. The objective of the Project is to build resilience of rural households by 
diversifying  their  sources  of  income  through  intensified  cluster-based  climate  resilient 
production systems of select value chains, promotion of farm and off-farm enterprises and 
building a supportive ecosystem. 
5. 
Components. The Project shall consist of the following Components:  
5.1  Component 1: Inclusive cluster development. The component will be implemented 
through  two  sub-components:  1.1  -  Livelihoods  diversification  and  enterprise 
development;  and  1.2  -  Institutional  strengthening  of  CBOs  and  partnerships.  The 
objective of sub-component 1.1 is to build the capabilities of individual farm households, 
self-help groups and producer groups to diversify livelihoods opportunities. The objective 
of sub-component 1.2 is to strengthen the capacity of CBOs to increase their outreach to 
target households and to develop into viable inclusive farmer institutions. 
5.2  Component  2:  Ecosystem  for  enterprise  development.  The  component  will  be 
implemented  through  two  sub-components:  2.1:  Strengthening  support  services  and 
market  infrastructure.  The  objective  of  sub-component  2.1  is  to  develop  the  enabling 
conditions for livelihoods, enterprise and value chain development by establishing last mile 
market  infrastructure,  providing  support  services  and  scaling  up  a  youth  incubation 
scheme. The objective of sub-component 2.2 is to support project activities by facilitating 
access to financial services. 
5.3.  Component  3:  Project  Management,  M&E  and  Knowledge  Management.  A  Project 
Management Unit (PMU) will be established at both State and District level. The state level 
PMU will be led by a Project Director and at district level by District Project Managers in all 
13 districts. The PMU will converge with government Projects and projects that will actively 
support  project  implementation  both  technically  and  financially.  A  High  Powered 
Committee will provide strategic oversight.

EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1  
Integrated project risk matrix 
Country Context 
Political Commitment 
Risk:  
The risk is moderate, primarily owing to the fact that the State 
Government is due for elections next year.  
Mitigations:  
India is a stable democracy. No major political risks are perceived 
that may affect the project. The Govt of Uttarakhand has provided 
necessary clearances and a Cabinet Approval is in process.  
Governance 
Risk:  
The risk is low. India is a union of States with a constitutional 
distribution of powers between the Centre and the State 
Governments. A 2019 Report on Good Governance Index (GGI) has 
placed Uttarakhand as 2nd among 11 North Eastern and Hill States 
of India. 
Mitigations:  
No major interventions needed from the project. 
Macroeconomic 
Risk:  
The present inflation rate is low. State finances are partially affected 
by the burden of the pandemic and economic slowdown, where 
lockdowns are still implemented to contain the spread of the 
Covid19.  
Mitigations:  
Macroeconomic risks, especially risks of insufficient counterpart 
funding by the state are low and unlikely to compromise the 
achievement of the project’s development outcomes. The project is 
focused on diversification of income of poor HHs and will mitigate 
adverse impacts of macroeconomic factors at HH level.  
Fragility and Security 
Risk:  
No significant issues of fragility and security in the state.

No interventions needed.  
Sector Strategies and Policies 
Policy alignment 
Risk:  
Conducive policy environment exists for the project focus areas. In 
particular issues related to commercialisation of agriculture, 
formation of FPOs, contract farming and promotion of youth 
enterprises will be aligned with existing government strategies, 
policies and schemes.  
Mitigations:  
Moderate  Low 
Low 
Low 
Low 
Low 
The project will be aligned to the Government schemes & strategies.  
Policy Development and Implementation 
Risk:  
Moderate  Low 
The risk is moderate. While the project will be fully aligned to 
sectoral policies related to agriculture, youth and MSME, some of 
the Agriculture related policies of the Government are currently on 
hold (eg Contract farming). 
Moderate  Low 
Mitigations:  
The project will also undertake policy engagement related to: (i) 
youth employment and the scaling up of the youth incubation 
schemes, (ii) development of a road map for SHG graduation to 
FPOs including a value chain orientation, and (iii) up-scaling a 
training programme on group business management and marketing 
to support cooperative and FPO development. 
Environment and Climate Context 
Project vulnerability to environmental conditions 
Risk:  
Direct environmental risks and impacts are considered moderate. 
The Project will not support land use changes that will affect forests, 
protected areas, important bird habitats, and will not clear 
contiguous area of above 100ha in a single location. Project 
activities to be implemented in mountainous areas will likely be 
prone to erosion, whereas projects located in the plains will likely be 
susceptible to pollution from runoff from floods.  
Mitigations:  
The project will not intervene in environmentally sensitive areas. 
Site-specific environmental mitigation measures will include erosion

control measures, soil and water conservation, environmentally 
friendly and climate-resilient production and processing systems, 
including promoting climate smart agriculture practices and natural 
resources-based livelihood options that have positive impact on the 
environment. 
Project vulnerability to climate change impacts 
Risk:  
High 
Moderate 
Prolonged periods of drought combined with rainfall variability may 
have impact on water availability, increase in crop-water demand, 
emergence of new pests and reduced availability of feed and fodder. 
High 
Moderate 
Mitigations:  
Building on the successes of ILSP, the project will promote flood 
and erosion control measures while introducing climate adaptation 
interventions such as drought tolerant crops, agro-forestry, soil and 
water conservation measures and livelihood diversification activities 
that will significantly reduce the risk. Selection of value chains will 
take into consideration the changing weather patterns, erratic rainfall 
and prolonged droughts. 
Project Scope 
Project Relevance 
Risk:  
The project scope is within the Government policies and the 
mandate of the Line Department.  
Mitigations:  
The project has a robust governance system to ensure the project 
alignment with state policies and continued relevance. There is a 
high level of interest in the project within the government which 
was reflected in the full ownership of the project design process 
from the highest levels within the state government and the 
concerned Line Department. 
Technical Soundness 
Risk:  
The project envisages working across different sectors and 
geography (plain and hilly districts) – an approach that has its set of 
inherent complexities. Most of the ideas promoted through the 
project have been tried and tested in various projects.

EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1  
REAP will cover the full state which means all 13 districts and 95 
Community Development Blocks (CDBs). This is a significant 
expansion from the coverage under ILSP, which was implemented 
in 11 districts but only 44 CDBs. This expansion will be done 
through partnership with USRLM, which is also being implemented 
by the RDD, the lead Department implementing REAP. This will 
ensure full co-ordination at all levels. The two new plains districts 
being included for the first time, will be critical for providing access 
to wider markets.  
ILSP’s experience of working in the agricultural sector will reduce 
risks in interventions in cluster-based agribusiness development; 
however, experience in adopting the value chain approach and non-
farm sector initiatives is nascent. To mitigate potential risks, the 
project has planned multiple trainings and technical assistance for 
UGVS and LCs/CLF on enterprise development, value chain 
development, and financial services and will be implemented in 
convergence with the Government of Uttarakhand. Besides, the 
project will launch smaller and less risky value chains in the initial 
years of the project, and after successful completion, will move to 
larger and complex value chains.  
Institutional Capacity for Implementation and Sustainability 
Implementation Arrangements 
Risk:  
The lead implementing agency (UGVS) has previous experience of 
implementing IFAD supported project in the state. The agency has a 
team of qualified and experienced staff. The key challenge is to 
implement sustainable enterprise development and fee-for-services 
which requires intense networking and liaison with the government 
and the private sector.  
Mitigations:  
To mitigate these risks, UGVS under the project will have dedicated 
PMU and additional trained staff members in all districts. Through 
the project, UGVS will seek help of sector experts in designing 
value chain subprojects. Moreover, the project will enhance its 
institutional capacity through targeted trainings and exposures. The 
project will engage competent Project Management Consultants to 
support the project in business incubation and start ups and 
enterprise promotion.

EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1  
The Lead Implementing Agency has instituted a very robust MIS 
and M&E system. Under the new project the key challenge will be 
to expand this system to cover the various value chains across 
various sectors. 
Mitigations:  
Management Information system will be strengthened to cover new 
elements of the project including value chains. Also the M&E 
system will be participatory and decentralized involving key target 
groups in identification of project activities and monitoring 
implementation of project. This will in-turn ensure sustainability of 
project interventions. 
Project Financial Management 
Project Organization and Staffing 
Risk:  
Except the Director (Finance), the other finance and accounting staff 
will be appointed on contract from the open market initially for a 
period of 3 years with performance review at the end of ever year. 
The quality of staff will determine the quality of FM. 
Mitigations:  
• Adequate and trained finance staff with clear job description and 
accountability lines;  
• Customized, user-friendly software and PIM.  
Project Budgeting 
Risk:  
Preparation of timely budgets incorporating the proposed 
expenditure by components, categories and financiers. 
Mitigations:  
• To ensure proper process of preparation of AWPB using the 
bottom-up approach and regular review of the  
physical and financial progress;  
• Regularly track the achievement with the budget and report on 
quarterly basis.  
Project Funds Flow/Disbursement Arrangements 
Risk:  
The AWPB of the project is built into the State Budget and funds 
released from the Treasury in a timely manner to meet the 
implementation needs of the project.

Mitigations:  
• Ensure timely release of budget for project activities in accordance 
with the AWPB. 
Project Internal Controls 
Risk:  
Effective internal control systems which are currently lacking as 
reported by the auditor of ILSP.  
Having an effective internal audit system with quarterly reports and 
compliances.  
Mitigations:  
• Segregation of fiduciary -sensitive duties;  
• Periodic reconciliations;  
• Restricting access to accounting files and documents;  
• Periodic count of inventories and fixed assets;  
• Having an effective system of internal audit to be conducted 
quarterly.  
Project Accounting and Financial Reporting 
Risk:  
Use of accounting software (customized) to record transactions to 
generate reports by components, categories and financiers, 
comparison with the budgets and preparation of the quarterly IUFR 
for submission along with the WA. 
Mitigations:  
• Accountant will need to be proficient in the use of the accounting 
software;  
• Back-up of accounting records;  
• Use of register of fixed assets;  
• Project Implementation Manual (PIM) to detail reporting and 
monitoring requirements and rules;  
• Use of financial statements templates consistent with IFAD 
reporting requirements.  
Project External Audit

• The auditor will be a CAG empanelled firm of Chartered 
Accountants;  
• Ensure reporting as required by IFAD Guidelines;  
• Prompt implementation of auditor’s recommendations.  
Project Procurement 
Legal and Regulatory Framework 
Risk:  
The risk that the Borrower’s regulatory and institutional capacity 
and practices (including compliance with the laws) are inadequate to 
conduct the procurement in a manner that optimizes value for 
money with integrity. The risk is substantial. The State Framework, 
Uttarakhand Procurement Rules (UPR) is not fully consistent with 
IFAD Procurement Guidelines. Procurement related complaints 
redressal are addressed through existing legal provisions and 
General Financial Rules, which are lengthy and layered. No 
Standard Bid Documents prescribed under UPR. Compliance with 
IFAD Procurement norms will be needed.  
Mitigations:  
The project design suggests the project procurement follows the 
IFAD Procurement Guidelines and Procurement Handbook. Project 
will be familiarised with IFAD Procurement Guidelines and 
Handbook and IFAD prior review thresholds 
Accountability and Transparency 
Risk:  
The risk that accountability, transparency and oversight 
arrangements (including the handling of complaints regarding, for 
example, SH/SEA and fraud and corruption) are inadequate to 
safeguard the integrity of project procurement and contract 
execution, leading to the unintended use of funds, misprocurement, 
SH/SEA, and/or execution of project procurements outside of the 
required time, cost and quality requirements. The project will have 
decentralized implementation and procurement. There is risk of 
noncompliance with agreed procurement arrangements.  
Mitigations:  
Several mitigation measures are proposed: 1) PMU will have overall 
Procurement responsibility and accountability; 2)a robust two-tiered 
complaint handling mechanism will be put in place at the LPA. The 
complaint handling authority, the form of complaint register, 
response time, decision-making mechanism, and other features will 
be outlined in detail in the PIM; In addition, the State Government 
26 
Appendix III                 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1  
will also designate an independent investigative authority 3) IFAD 
will conduct implementation support missions to review the 
procurement performance of the project. All contracts not covered 
under prior review by IFAD will be subject to post review during 
the implementation support missions and/or special post-review 
missions along with a sample of prior reviewed procurement 
actions; 4) for activities at community level, annual PPR for an 
appropriate percentage of contracts shall be conducted by IFAD. In 
addition Audits will also be conducted. 
Capability in Public Procurement 
Risk:  
The risk that the implementing agency does not have sound 
processes, procedures, systems and personnel in place for the 
administration, supervision and management of contracts resulting 
in adverse impacts to the development outcomes of the project. The 
risk is moderate as the REAP Implementing agency is familiar with 
the IFAD procurement procedures and norms, but not conversant 
with the revised risk based approach.  
Mitigations:  
Mitigation measures include: 1) appropriate qualified procurement 
staffing at SPMU and DPMU level; 2) strengthening and capacity 
building of staff at State level and partners. 3) Guidelines for 
investment grants evaluation procedures will be put in place; 4) 
Engagement of resource persons in the evaluation process for 
technical advice.  
Public Procurement Processes 
Risk:  
The risk that procurement processes and market structures (methods, 
planning, bidding, contract award and contract management) are 
inefficient and/or anti-competitive, resulting in the misuse of project 
funds or sub-optimal implementation of the project and achievement 
of its objectives.It is assessed that highly decentralized project 
implementation and absence of qualified procurement staff may 
result in delays in procurement and contract management processes  
Mitigations:  
REAP PMU will setup a Procurement Unit to handle procurements 
and contract management as per IFAD regulations. 2)IFAD will 
inform the recommended thresholds for procurement and also IFAD 
prior review thresholds through LtB; 3) the PIM will specify the 
delegation and procurement implementation arrangements; 4) all 
procurement activities at SPMU and DPMU level including

Standard Bid Documents, evaluation templates and contract 
monitoring and reporting through IFAD ICP portal; 6) All exception 
reporting will be informed to the Project Oversight Committee 7) all 
records from procurement planning to contract completion and 
procurement complaints shall be retained in a chronological order 
and made available as and when requested by IFAD. 
Environment, Social and Climate Impact 
Biodiversity Conservation 
Risk:  
The nature and magnitude of project activities will not entail 
conversion of critical or natural habitat for agricultural land use or 
promote unstainable harvesting of Non-Timber Forest Products 
(NTFP) that might lead to biodiversity loss or cause significant 
threat to availability of ecosystem services. 
Mitigations:  
Building on successes of ILSP and convergence with government 
programs on watershed and biodiversity management, selection and 
siting of project activities will avoid protected and forested areas. 
Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention 
Risk:  
Pollution of soil and water due to the use of agro-chemicals for 
crops and generation of manure from livestock is moderate. 
Mitigations:  
To minimise soil and water pollution, site-specific Environmental 
and Social Management Plan (ESMP) will include an Integrated 
Pest Management Plan to guide on the application, storage, handling 
and disposal of agro-chemicals and waste management practices. 
The use of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems and climate smart 
agriculture practices, will promote efficient use of resources 
particularly water.

The project targeting strategy which will have relevant tools of 
ensuring that the poorest and most vulnerable including STs are 
benefiting from project activities and VPGs will ensure that those 
most vulnerable are not left out. Both, under USRLM and ILSP, the 
ST communities have been mobilised under various groups. REAP 
will ensure that project interventions are dovetailed with the Tribal 
Development Sub Plan where applicable to bring the benefit of 
government schemes to add to the project interventions for the ST 
communities.  
Labour and Working Conditions 
Risk:  
Women could be adversely impacted and their workload can 
increase due to their participation in project activities as women in 
Uttarakhand are already overburdened and heavily involved in both 
household and agriculture activities. There is some risk of children, 
especially young girls being involved more in household level work 
and use of child labour in the community livelihood activities  
Mitigations:  
The project will promote modern and women friendly production 
technology and drudgery reduction tools and equipment. Alternative 
livelihoods promoted under the project may offer women and young 
persons less labour intensive alternatives.  
The project will develop a guideline to address the potential risks of 
child labour and ensure that all service providers’, rural institutions 
developed and strengthened under the project activities and 
management committees are oriented properly on prevention of 
child labour laws. The project will follow Government of India’s 
guidelines on curbing child labour and any third party contract under 
the project with suppliers, procurers and service providers will have 
29 
Appendix III                 
EB 2021/134/R.39/Rev.1  
no child labour clause. The site-specific Environmental and Social 
Management Plan (ESMP) will include Health and Safety practices 
to guide SMES  
Community Health and Safety 
Risk:  
Risks related to health and safety of communities due to disease 
transmission particularly of COVID-19 is significant.  
The risk of continued outbreaks of COVID-19 could result in a 
further influx of returnee migrants which could have a potential 
impact on project start-up and implementation.  
Mitigations:  
The GoUK has put in place Standard Operating Procedures for the 
control and management of Covid-19 pandemic and has been among 
the better managed states in the country. Additionally, the project 
will develop Community Health and Safety guidelines, knowledge 
products and implement campaigns that build awareness and 
capacity among the project communities on safety and hygiene 
practices in the context of the ongoing pandemic and proposed 
project interventions and all project activities will strictly follow 
Government of Uttarakhand COVID-19 related policies and 
safeguards. 
Whilst start up could be impacted REAP will mitigate the risk by 
prioritizing activities that could be conducted remotely. Staff 
recruitment, engagement of service providers and initial trainings 
and related activities of the project are not likely to be adversely 
impacted.

Vulnerability of target populations and ecosystems to climate 
variability and hazards 
Risk:  
Increase in temperature combined with rainfall variability may have 
impact on water availability, increase in crop-water demand (due to 
increased evapotranspiration), emergence of new pests and reduced 
availability of feed and fodder. 
Mitigations:  
REAP will promote flood and erosion control measures while 
introducing climate adaptation interventions such as drought tolerant 
crops, agro-forestry, soil and water conservation measures and 
livelihood diversification activities. Selection of value chains will 
take into consideration the changing weather patterns, erratic rainfall 
and prolonged droughts. 
Stakeholders 
Stakeholder Engagement/Coordination 
Risk:  
The risk is primarily related to engagement of private sector, 
technical institutions and banks. 
Mitigations:  
Banks and financial institutions will be major partners in the project. 
RDD has on-going relations with multiple banks which will be 
further strengthened. The SHG/PGs/livelihood collectives -Bank 
Linkage programme will have some initial challenges. Piloting of 
innovative financial products for enterprises is also proposed. 
Convergence with other government schemes including USRLM is 
also proposed under the project and a pro-poor financial inclusion 
approach will be followed. The project will develop a detailed 
targeting strategy and targeting action plan so that the client base is 
expanded to ensure that women, youth, SCs, STs are included.  
For the risk of low performance by technical/training service 
providers the project will ensure proper due diligence before 
selecting partners and build risk mitigating mechanisms (financial / 
performance bank guarantees) into contracts. ILSP has also set up a 
system for performance assessment of Technical Agency partner 
which will be used.  
For mitigating the risk of low mobilization of private sector the

project proposes setting up multi stakeholder platforms and also 
expand the partnerships already built under ILSP.  
Stakeholder Grievances 
Risk:  
Stakeholders may not be aware of the systems for the redressal of 
their grievances. 
Mitigations:  
The Government of Uttarakhand has a portal for registration of 
public grievances (http://samadhan.uk.gov.in). Each district has a 
phone number and a local helpline number too. The project will 
make communities aware of this portal and the systems for 
registering their grievances. Also the RDD conducts Social Audit of 
various schemes from time to time. Additionally,  
the project will establish a grievance redress mechanism specifically 
to address project related concerns and grievances from project 
related persons. The grievance procedure and disciplinary procedure 
will be put in place in consultation with implementing agency, 
project management unit and related government departments. 
Access to a grievance redress mechanism will be provided to all 
concerned with the project.In addition, the community will be 
oriented and trained in access and use of grievance redressal 
mechanisms.
