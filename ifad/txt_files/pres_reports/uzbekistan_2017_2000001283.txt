EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Agriculture Diversification and
Modernization Project, as contained in paragraph 42.
Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan
for the Agriculture Diversification and Modernization
Project
I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1.
Uzbekistan is a 447,400 km2 landlocked country in Central Asia bordering
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan. It had a
population of 31.8 million in 2016, of which approximately 60 per cent is rural.
With a per capita gross domestic product of US$2,130 in 2015, Uzbekistan is a
lower-middle-income country. Data suggest that its economic growth has been
broad based and inclusive.
2.
3.
Agriculture provides approximately 25 per cent of the country’s employment and
its share of the gross domestic product was estimated at 17.6 per cent in 2014.
Approximately 40 per cent of Uzbekistan’s rural population is directly engaged in
agriculture-related activities. Food imports meet the country’s growing demand and
the population’s enhanced purchasing capacity is increasingly applied to high-value
goods, particularly meat and dairy products. In 2015, Uzbekistan’s agricultural
imports totalled 11.5 per cent of the country’s total imports (US$1.3 billion)
according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Poverty declined from 27.5 per cent in 2001 to 14 per cent in 2015. This was
attributed to rapid economic growth, creation of new small businesses and
employment, public investments in education, health and infrastructure, increases
in public-sector salaries and increased remittances. In 2015, the poverty rate in
rural areas was 17 per cent compared with 11 per cent among the urban
population. The country’s low agricultural productivity, high tax burden among the
rural population, high dependency within households, regional disparities and lack
of formal rural labour markets are drivers of rural poverty. A lack of access to
productive assets, infrastructure, energy, land and water, technical and financial
services contribute to poverty and limited productivity, especially among rural
women and young people. Other vulnerable groups include families with many
children, people with disabilities, unemployed people and those with lower
education levels.
B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
4.
RB-COSOP
Diversification, modernization and import substitution of agricultural production is a
government policy priority as stipulated in Presidential Decree No.2460 on
agriculture sector reforms and development for 2016-2020, and the Welfare
Improvement Strategy (2013-2015). Diversification of products, particularly
horticultural crops, livestock and related sub-sectors is expected to enhance rural
families’ incomes and reduce the number of low-income households. IFAD’s
experience with the value chain approach in the region suggests that private-sector
actors are crucial for smallholder producers to participate in value chains. Traders,
buyers, aggregators, processors, exporters and other private players shape how
1
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
value chains perform. From the viewpoint of smallholder producers (Dekhan and
small private farmers), conducive partnerships with the private sector present a
major opportunity for sustained income generation. The project integrates
private-sector operators willing to invest time and resources to increase value
chain competitiveness in a way that enhances the benefits for smallholder
producers and supports their efforts to strengthen their businesses. This also
makes value chains more inclusive of smallholder producers.
5.
The project will work with selected value chains, providing holistic and coordinated
support to all actors in order to improve their performance. Agribusinesses and
other qualified entities will be invited to take the role of leading entity, with a focus
on those willing to develop sound business models through productive partnerships
with their suppliers. Smallholder producers, who are the project’s primary target
group, will be targeted in each selected value chain in order to enhance their
inclusiveness and improve their returns from agriculture. The project’s targeting
strategy will therefore incorporate the principles of smallholder inclusiveness.
II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
6.
Geographical target. The project will be implemented in the Fergana Valley in the
regions of Andijan, Fergana and Namangan. The country strategic opportunities
programme highlights the challenges experienced in the Fergana Valley due to high
population density; Namangan registers the second lowest per capita gross
domestic product in the country. Women make up half the population, with
women-headed households comprising 18 per cent of the total. Approximately
20 per cent of youth are unemployed.
7.
8.
Target groups. The project’s main target groups are: (i) rural low-income
households on Dekhan farms, who are striving to increase income from agriculture
through active participation in project-supported value chains; (ii) small private
horticulture and livestock farmers with a farm size of up to 5 hectares; (iii)
agribusinesses with existing or potential linkages with groups (i) and (ii); and
(iv) rural youth. Special attention will be paid to ensure the participation of
women-headed Dekhan and private farming households, and young women.
Beneficiaries. The project is expected to directly reach 75,000 households and
approximately 21,000 indirect beneficiaries. These include 11,000 households
benefitting of loans and training, and approximately 54,000 incremental suppliers
of the leading entities benefitting from project loans. In addition, 10,000 full-time
jobs will be created by the leading entities’ incremental economic activities. In its
first phase, the project is expected to reach out directly to 30,000 households, and
about 10,000 indirect beneficiaries. These include 5,000, households benefitting
from loans and training, plus approximately 20,000 incremental suppliers of the
leading entities (LEs) benefitting from ADMP loans, and some 4,000 ful-time
equivalent incremental jobs created by the LEs’ incremental economic activities.
B. Project development objective
9.
The project’s goal is to improve the incomes and livelihoods of rural people in the
target area. Its development objective is to increase the inclusiveness and
profitability of selected value chains through enhanced productivity, market access
and improved natural resource management.
2
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
C. Components/outcomes
10. The project will have three interrelated components; a fourth component will
support project management and implementation. The components are:
(i) inclusive value chain development; (ii) inclusive rural finance; (iii) climate-
resilient rural infrastructure; and (iv) project management.
11. Component 1: Inclusive value chain development. The outcome of this
component will be enhanced capacity for sustainable and efficient performance of
targeted stakeholders, and an enabling business environment for agribusinesses in
selected value chains, with strong backward linkages with smallholder producers.
This component aims to strengthen the capacities of farmers and other
stakeholders in targeted value chains. Three activities will be implemented to
create an enabling business environment for agribusinesses: (i) value chain
mapping exercises based on rapid market assessment results for small ruminants,
fisheries, sericulture and honey prepared during the design; (ii) rapid market
assessments of additional sub-sectors; and (iii) preparation of value chain
development plans, which will be roadmaps for LEs.
12. Component 2: Inclusive rural finance. The outcome of this component will be
increased productivity and efficiency among targeted smallholders, enabling value
chain actors to increase their investments in profitable value chains. The project
will support the State Fund for Support of the Development of Entrepreneurial
Activity in providing credit guarantees to smallholders and rural entrepreneurs who
lack acceptable collateral by offering partial coverage of lending risks. It will also
work with banks interested in lending to farmers in the target regions (and that
meet the project’s eligibility criteria) to facilitate farmers’ and agricultural
businesses’ access to financing. Finally, this component will establish a credit
window for youth who lack access to affordable and flexible lending products.
Banks will be free to set their own interest rates, allowing them to serve project
beneficiaries in a sustainable manner. These banks will be selected through a
competitive process to ensure that those offering the best conditions are chosen.
The outcome will be measured by the following indicator: PFIs’ portfolio risk is
below 5 per cent.
13. Component 3: Climate-resilient rural infrastructure. This component aims to
remove bottlenecks to a reliable irrigation water supply, which inhibit Dekhans and
small farmers from enhancing the diversification and efficiency of agriculture in the
selected value chains. This will be achieved through modernization of the inter-
farm irrigation network operated by water consumer associations (WCAs). It will
enable targeted farmers’ groups to: (i) diversify agricultural production from low-
value to high-value crops; (ii) increase land productivity; (iii) address the
challenges of drought due to climate change; and (iv) increase the capacity of
WCAs and the Basin Irrigation System Administration in efficient water resource
management and irrigation system operation and maintenance. The outcome of
this component will be improved farmland productivity resulting from modernized
irrigation infrastructure, as measured by the following indicator: at least 1,000
farmers report improved supply of irrigation water and increased productivity.
III. Project implementation
Approach
A.
14. The project will promote a demand-driven value chain approach. This approach will
focus on analysing each step of the value chain and investing in those needs that
have the potential to improve the productivity, profitability and competitiveness of
value chain players, especially Dekhan farmers.
15. The project will promote the upgrading of selected value chains and will include
actions taken by producers, processors, input suppliers and traders at various
points in the value chain to increase future productive capacity and
3
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
competitiveness. The leading entities with successful value chain development
plans prepared through component 1 will be considered for receiving loans from
PFIs through component 2. While loan applications will be assessed individually,
the project will provide support to their business operations through the provision
of technical assistance and training to farmer suppliers and other actors, and
access to improved infrastructure under component 3 to enhance value chains’
competitiveness and efficiency. The project will also promote coordination with
projects funded by other donors, especially those managed by the Rural
Restructuring Agency (RRA) – based on smooth information flow and open dialogue
– in order to ensure synergies and avoid duplication of efforts.
B. Organizational framework
16. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources will have overall responsibility for
managing the project on behalf of the Government. Daily oversight will rest with a
project management unit (PMU) under the RRA, a state entity within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Water Resources. Overall management oversight will rest with an
inter-agency council for cooperation with international financial institutions, foreign
governments and donor countries implementing large-scale investment projects.
This council will provide guidance and direction to the project implementing
agency; the project manager will act as secretary to the council.
17. The PMU will be led by a project manager and be composed of: a chief accountant;
procurement officer; rural finance/youth officer; administrative
assistant/translator; and driver. The project will utilize legal staff from the Dairy
Value Chains Development Project. In addition, the project will rely on the services
of national and international specialists in various fields. A project implementation
team will be established in one of the project regions in year 1 (the region will be
determined by the Government, but will most likely be Namangan). The team will
comprise a: regional coordinator (value chain and business specialist); three rural
finance and youth officers; engineer; a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) specialist
and a driver. Regional coordinators will be recruited to coordinate project activities
in the remaining regions. The project implementation team will be responsible for
daily implementation of all aspects of the project, except for financial
administration and procurement, which will be managed by the PMU within RRA.
C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management
18. The project results framework will form the basis for the results-based M&E
system, including performance monitoring and impact assessment. The PMU/M&E
officer will be responsible for all internal M&E of the project. The PMU will submit
progress reports in English to the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, the
Ministry of Finance and IFAD. A mid-term review will be carried out towards the
end of the project’s third year. During the final year of project implementation, as
part of the preparation of the project completion report and impact assessment
required by IFAD, the M&E data collected over the project implementation period
will be used in a thorough assessment of project achievements. This assessment
will focus on changes in beneficiaries’ livelihoods as a result of project activities,
and the sharing of lessons learned and experiences.
19. Learning and knowledge management. To ensure that the experiences gained
are captured, comprehensive provisions have been made for M&E. The project’s
knowledge management programme will be an essential tool for meeting project
objectives. Two approaches will be used: (i) a knowledge management programme
for supporting within- and between-project learning; and (ii) support for a broader
knowledge management programme aimed at informing government decision
makers and influencing policies. The project will also support efforts to broaden
information dissemination through: development of farmer networks (to share
knowledge on successful adaptation); farmer-to-farmer extension approaches
4
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
(to facilitate technology transfer); development of private technical services
(e.g. private veterinarians); and strengthening linkages among universities,
research and development institutions, and farmer networks to ensure the
relevance of the technology.
D. Financial management, procurement and governance
20.
In accordance with IFAD guidelines, a financial management assessment was
undertaken. The inherent risk was assessed as high. In order to mitigate this risk,
a stand-alone PMU will be established within RRA with separate financial
management arrangements. This system is already in place for ongoing IFAD
projects and some World Bank projects, and the quality of financial management
has been largely assessed as satisfactory. As a result, the new project will be able
to draw on the capacities already established and working satisfactorily as part of
the ongoing IFAD projects. The ongoing IFAD project, the Horticultural Support
Project, has also shown strong disbursement rates with regards to credit lines.
21. Financial Management. The PMU, with support from the RRA finance unit, will be
responsible for the financial management of the project, including budgeting,
accounting, preparing withdrawal applications, monitoring implementing partners,
preparing consolidated financial reports and internal and external audit
arrangements.
22. Accounting and financial reporting arrangements. The accounting, financial
reporting and audit arrangements have already been established under the ongoing
IFAD projects. Accordingly, all project transactions will be recorded in customized
accounting and financial software on a cash basis in accordance with International
Public Sector Accounting Standards, and quarterly financial reports will be prepared
in formats agreed with IFAD. The project's consolidated financial statements will be
audited annually by an independent audit firm in accordance with internationally
accepted auditing standards and IFAD’s Guidelines on Project Audits.
23. Disbursement arrangements and flow of funds. IFAD financing will be
disbursed in accordance with IFAD disbursement procedures to be specified in the
programme implementation manual and letter to the borrower. Two separate
designated accounts denominated in United States dollars (US$) will be opened for
the IFAD loan and grant in a commercial bank, and will not be mingled with other
funds. From the designated accounts, the funds will flow to the project account
denominated in Uzbek sum (UZS) to finance eligible project expenditures. From the
designated loan account and the project loan account, funds (US$ or UZS) will be
transferred to incremental credit accounts (one account in US$ and one in UZS)
maintained by the PFIs in the form of credit to finance sub-projects undertaken by
beneficiaries. Transfers to the rural guarantee facility will be made using the direct-
payment method to a separate account maintained in US$ in a commercial bank,
and IFAD funds will not be mingled with other funds. Specific conditions for
disbursement will be included in the financing agreement to ensure that proper
safeguards are in place before transferring any funds to the PFIs and the
Guarantee Facility and remedies will be applied in case of non-compliance.
24. Procurement. As part of the detailed project design, IFAD assessed the public
procurement systems and institutions in Uzbekistan for the purpose of identifying
an entity to handle procurement. Despite recent efforts to modernize and
strengthen Uzbekistan’s public procurement system, there are critical gaps in
compatibility with IFAD’s procurement guidelines and procedures. However, the
capacity of RRA to conduct procurement was found to be in line with IFAD
procurement regulations and procedures.
25. Anti-corruption policy. IFAD applies a zero-tolerance policy towards fraudulent,
corrupt, collusive or coercive actions in all projects financed through its loans and
grants. IFAD’s anticorruption policy and whistleblowing procedures will be included
in the project implementation manual.
5
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
E. Supervision
26. Supervision and implementation support. A supervision plan covering the
period until the mid-term review will be agreed at project start-up. The project will
be supervised directly by IFAD. This will include annual risk-based financial
management supervision by a financial management specialist and operational
reviews covering a random sample of project activities, to be carried out in project
years 2 and 4 by independent auditors and under terms of reference acceptable to
IFAD. Details of financial management supervision are provided in appendix 7 of
the project design document. The timely completion of a baseline survey in line
with the project’s outcome and output indicators is fundamental to effective project
supervision.
IV. Project costs, financing, and benefits
A. Project costs
27. The main assumptions underlying the derivation of project costs, estimated project
costs and financing plan are that: (i) project costs are based on September 2017
prices; (ii) the project will be financed over a six-year period; and (iii) the official
annual inflation rate of 5.7 per cent is taken as constant for the duration of the
project period (2018-2023). The international inflation rate is set at 2 per cent per
year in line with medium- to long-term projections of the Economist Intelligence
Unit and the World Bank Group (Commodity Market Outlook, January 2017) for the
United States dollars. Further to the devaluation of the UZS on 5 September 2017,
the base exchange rate for this analysis was set at UZS 8,092 to US$1 as the
official exchange rate prevailing at the end of the final design mission. Project costs
are presented in both UZS and US$; conversions from current US$ values into UZS
use constant purchasing power exchange rates. A 20 per cent value-added tax will
be levied on all imported and locally procured goods and services. For directly
recruited local staff, the project will cover the social insurance rate of 25 per cent.
28. Project costs. The total investment and incremental recurrent project costs,
including physical and price contingencies, are estimated at approximately
US$159.6 million (UZS 1,291 billion). Physical and price contingencies are 1 per
cent of the total project cost. This is largely due to the fact that investments
associated with rural finance (lump sum with no contingency) comprise
approximately 88 per cent of the total project costs. The foreign-exchange
component is estimated at US$112.4 million or 70 per cent of the total project
cost. This is due to the fact that most of the project financing is in the form of
credit lines which will be used by the beneficiaries to purchase assets for local
production and also for financing the export of their produce. The Government's
contribution, mainly in the form of taxes, represents 17 per cent of the total cost,
or US$27.0 million. The project management cost is approximately 1.4 per cent of
the total project cost (US$2.2 million). Table 1 provides a summary of the project
financing plan by component.

B. Project financing
29. The project will be financed through multiple sources, including an IFAD loan, an
IFAD grant, the Government, beneficiaries and PFIs. The IFAD loan from the
2016-2018 performance-based allocation system (PBAS) totalling US$46.2 million
will cover 29 per cent of project costs, contributing to: 37 per cent of the inclusive
value chains development component (component 1, totalling US$10.8 million);
28 per cent of the inclusive rural finance component (component 2,
US$141.8 million); 21 per cent of the climate-resilient rural infrastructure
component (component 3, US$5.3 million); and 62 per cent of the project
management component (component 4, US$ 2.2 million). In addition, IFAD will
provide a grant of US$300,000 to cover part of the international technical
assistance and training provided under component 1, and technical assistance to
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources under component 2. The Government
will waive all taxes related to project expenditures, including all those associated
with goods and services procured with the loans generated by the project’s funded
credit lines, and the social fund associated with personnel. The Government's
contribution,  mainly in the form of taxes, represents 17 per cent of the total cost
or US$27.0 million. PFIs are expected to contribute US$19.5 million to match the
funds made available by the project. Beneficiaries will contribute at least
US$19.5 million. The financing gap of US$47 million may be sourced by
subsequent PBAS cycles (under financing terms to be determined and subject to
internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval), or by cofinancing
identified during implementation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
30. The project is expected to generate substantial net incremental benefits for farming
households, Dekhan farmers, commercial farmers, agri-firms and rural
entrepreneurs. These include: (i) at least 80 per cent of project beneficiaries
reporting at least a 20 per cent increase in income; (ii) at least 75,000 households
receiving services promoted or supported by the project; (iii) at least 10,000
full-time jobs (or equivalent) created; and (iv) at least 70 per cent of supported
smallholder producers, including Dekhans, reporting a 20 per cent increase in sales
along their value chains
31. Economic rate of return. On the basis of the above assumptions, the economic
analysis of the project indicates that the total investment gains are significant and
robust in economic terms. The analysis results in an internal economic rate of
return of 16.5 per cent and a net present value of US$33.7 million over 20 years
based on quantifiable benefits that relate directly to the activities undertaken by
the project.
D. Sustainability
32. The sustainability of the project’s results is based on: (i) the value chain-champion
business and technical capacity-building activities to be promoted; (ii) the
demand-driven nature of the intervention; and (iii) the preparation of value chain
development plans as the basis for all investments, which should lead to inclusive
and more equitable and profitable value chains. The project’s sustainability is also
based on an exit strategy that comprises: (i) ensuring the ownership by
beneficiaries of the financed activities; (ii) the participatory development of
demand-driven technology; (iii) integration along value chains, including input
8
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
suppliers and service providers; and (iv) limited project operational, staff and
recurrent costs.
E. Risk identification and mitigation
33. The major risks are: (i) a distortive policy environment; (ii) a lack of stakeholder
participation; (iii) market-related risks including potential exchange rate
fluctuations; (iv) a failure of communication; (v) deteriorating financial
performance of some PFIs; and (vi) the outbreak of transboundary animal disease,
(vii) complex flow of funds, as well as (viii) relatively large financing gap. Mitigation
measures include: regular supervision, and preparation of a detailed project
implementation manual; separate US$ accounts for IFAD financing and procedures
to manage foreign exchange risks, in-depth, participatory analysis of production
and business opportunities; intensive training for farmers on how to position their
products; establishment of proper contracts; training on business management;
regular project monitoring; annual assessment of banks against minimum eligibility
requirements; upgrading critical competencies in active disease surveillance and
reporting from the field; and ensuring that there are veterinary field staff capable
of sharing information and specimens with the Government’s veterinary disease
diagnostic laboratories. Moreover, specific conditions related to disbursement and
audit will be included in the financing agreement to ensure that proper safeguards
are in place with regards to funds being transferred to the PFIs and the guarantee
facility. The PFIs also will also be subject to strict monitoring measures, as well as
compliance based disbursement procedures. As the financing gap will mainly
finance credit lines, the project will still be able to function, even if the additional
financing does not materialize.
V. Corporate considerations
A.
Compliance with IFAD policies
34. The project design is aligned with all relevant IFAD strategies and policies,
including the: (i) Strategic Framework (2016-2025); (ii) Policy on Targeting;
(iii) Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment; (iv) Rural Finance
Policy; (v) Private-Sector Development and Partnership Strategy; (vi) Rural
Enterprise Policy; (vii) Environment and Natural Resource Management Policy; and
(viii) Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures. Given the nature
and extent of the likely environmental impacts, the project is classified as a
category B in line with IFAD’s environmental assessment procedures. The potential
negative environmental impacts are assessed to be within controllable limits.
Alignment and harmonization
B.
35. The project is closely aligned with and supports the Government’s priorities for
diversification and modernization of the agriculture sector, as expressed in the
Welfare Improvement Strategy (2013-2015) and Presidential Decree No.2460 on
agriculture sector reforms and development for 2016-2020, which stresses the
need to gradually shift from cotton and wheat to value-added commodities, and
introduce resource-saving technologies.
36. Seeking to avoid the duplication of efforts and foster complementarities while
taking advantage of business-related best practices and technological innovations,
the intervention strategy will be based on: (i) building partnerships with the
country’s private commercial sector, and related stakeholders; (ii) local research
institutions and industry associations, particularly for expanding technical
assistance services and market channels; (iii) harmonization with the initiatives of
development partners present in the country such as ADB, the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Bank; and (iv) the
principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
9
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
Innovations and scaling up
C.
37. The project has two main innovative features. First, it will introduce a rural
guarantee facility that will leverage up to five times the value of the facility; the
US$9.9 million invested will help to attract US$49.5 million into Uzbekistan’s
agricultural sector. IFAD will be a pioneer among international financial institutions
by investing in the State Fund, and will document and disseminate its experiences
among other funders to attract more resources to the State Fund. In addition, the
adoption of the specialized automated Cash-flow Linked Agri-Risk Assessment tool
for loan analysis and management will build the capacity of participating banks to
lend to the agricultural sector and manage their agricultural loan portfolios more
efficiently.
Policy engagement
D.
38. Successful policy engagement will depend on the capacity to generate analytical
evidence at the outcome and impact levels. To capture experience gained, two
approaches are envisaged: (i) a knowledge management programme within the
project to support within- and between-project learning; and (ii) support for a
broader programme of knowledge management aimed at informing government
decision-makers and influencing policy. Considering the relatively recent IFAD
experience in the country and collaboration with the ADB and the World Bank, IFAD
is transitioning to a more integrated, strategic, and programmatic dialogue to
identify barriers to a conducive business environment.
VI. Legal instruments and authority
39. A project financing agreement between the Republic of Uzbekistan and IFAD will
constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I.
40. The Republic of Uzbekistan is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.
41.
I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
VII. Recommendation
42.
I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of
the following resolution:
RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on blend terms to the Republic
of Uzbekistan in an amount equivalent to of forty-six million two hundred
thousand United States dollars (US$46,200,000) and upon such terms and
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.
RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Republic of
Uzbekistan in an amount equivalent to three hundred thousand United States
dollars (US$300,000) and upon such terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements
I.
Project Description
Project Area. The Project will be implemented in Fergana Valley, in the regions of
1.
Andijan, Fergana and Namangan.
2.
Target Population. The main target groups of the Project are: (i) rural households
of dehkan farms,  who  strive  to  increase  income  from  agriculture  through  active
participation in the Project supported value chains; (ii) small farmers engaged/interested
in  horticulture  and  livestock  (with  farm  size  of  up  to  5  ha);  (iii) agribusinesses  with
existing or potential linkages with (i) and (ii); and (iv) youth living in the Project regions.
Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  ensure  the  participation  of  female-headed households
both in dehkan and small farmers, as well as to reach out female youth.
In  its  first  phase,  the  Project  is  expected  to  reach  out  directly  to  30,000
3.
households,  and  about  10 000  indirect  beneficiaries.  These  include  5  000,  households
benefitting from  loans  and  training,  plus  approximately  20  000  incremental  suppliers  of
the Leading Entities (LEs) benefitting of ADMP loans, and some 4 000 full time equivalent
incremental jobs created by the LEs’ incremental economic activities.
Goal. The development goal of the Project to improve the incomes and livelihoods of
4.
rural people in the Project area.
Objective. The Project’s  Development  Objective  is  to  increase  inclusiveness  and
5.
profitability  of  selected  value  chains  through  enhanced  productivity,  market access  and
improved natural resources.
Components. The Project will have three principal inter-related components as well
6.
as another one to support Project management and implementation:
7.
this
Component 1: Inclusive  Value  Chains  Development:  The  outcome  of
component  is  enhanced  capacity  for  sustainable  and  efficient  performance  of  targeted
stakeholders and aimed to create an enabling business  environment for agribusinesses in
selected value chains (VC) with strong backward linkages with smallholder producers; and
to  strengthen  the  capacities  of  the  farmers  and  other  stakeholders  of  those  VCs.  Three
activities  will  be  implemented  under  this  component:  (i)  Value  Chain  Mapping  exercises
based  on  Rapid  Market  Assessment  results  for  small  ruminants,  fisheries,  sericulture  and
honey  prepared  during  the  design;  (ii)  Rapid  Market  Assessments  of  additional
sub-sectors; and (iii) Preparation of VC development Roadmaps for LEs.
8.
Component 2: Inclusive  Rural  Finance:  The  outcome  of  this  component  is
increased  productivity  and  efficiency  along  targeted  smallholder-inclusive  value  chains  to
enable  value  chain  actors  to increase investment  in  profitable  value  chains  through  the
provision of credit and a guarantee facility. The Project will support (i) the State Fund for
the  Support  of  the  Development  of  Entrepreneurial  Activity  (SFSDEA)  to  render  credit
guarantees  to  smallholders  and  other  rural enterprises  who  lack  acceptable  collateral  by
offering the partial coverage of lending risks; (ii) work with banks interested in lending to
agriculture  in  the  target  regions  and  meeting  the  Project’s  eligibility  criteria  to  facilitate
farmers and agricultural businesses’ access to finance; and (iii) establish credit window for
youth  who  are  underserved  by  financial  services  with  affordable  lending  products.  Banks
will  be  free  to  set  their  own  interest  rates  allowing  serving  the  Project  beneficiaries  in  a
sustainable manner; however the banks will be selected through a competitive process to
ensure that those offering the best conditions are chosen.
Component 3: Climate-resilient  Rural  Infrastructure: This  component  aims  at
9.
removing  bottlenecks  for  reliable  irrigation  water  supply,  which  inhibit  increasing
participation  for dehkans and  small  farmers  in  enhanced  diversification  and efficiency  of
4
Appendix I
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
agriculture  for  the  selected  value  chains.  This  will  be  achieved  through  modernization  of
inter-farm  irrigation  network  operated  by  Water  Consumer  Associations  (WCAs)  and  will
provide conditions for targeted farmers’ group to: (i) diversify agricultural production from
low to high value crops; (ii) increase land productivity; (iii) address challenges of drought
due  to  climate  change;  and  (iv)  increase  capacity  of  WCAs  and  Basin  Administration  of
Irrigation  System  (BAIS)  in  efficient  water  resource  management  and  irrigation  system
operation and maintenance.
II.
Implementation Arrangements
10.
Approach. The  Project  will  promote  a  demand  driven  value  chain  approach.  The
value chain approach will focus on analyzing each step of the value chain and investment
on  those  needs  which  have  the  potential  for  improving  productivity,  profitability  and
competitiveness of the value chain players, particularly focusing on dehkan farmers.
11.
The  Project  will  promote  upgrading  of  selected  value  chains  and  will  include
actions  taken  by  producers,  processors,  input  suppliers  and  traders  at  various  points  in
the value chain to increase future productive capacity and competitiveness. The LEs with
successful  Value  Chain  Roadmaps  prepared  under  Component  1  will  be  favourably
considered for receiving loans from PFIs under Component 2. While loan applications will
be assessed individually, the Project will provide complementary support to enhance their
business  operations  through  provision  of  technical  assistance  and  training to  farmer
suppliers and other actors as well as access to improved infrastructure under Component
3  to  enhance  overall  competitiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  value  chains.  The  ADMP  will
promote close coordination with projects funded by other donors organizations especially
with those projects also under the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA).
12.
Organizational  framework. The  MAWR  will  have  the  overall  responsibility  for
management of the Project on behalf of the Borrower/Recipient. Day-to-day oversight of
the ADMP’s management will rest with a Project Management Unit (PMU) under the RRA.
The  overall  management  oversight  of  the  Project  will  rest  with  an  Inter-agency  Council
(IC).  The  IC  is  an  inter-governmental  institutions  agency  for  Cooperation  with
International Financial Institutions, Foreign Government Agencies and Donor Countries in
Implementation of Large-scale and Strategically Important Investment Projects.
13.
The PMU for the ADMP  will be headed by a Project Manager and be composed of
(preliminary):  a  Chief  Accountant;  Procurement  Officer;  Rural  Finance  /Youth  Officer;
Administrative  Assistant;  and  a  Driver.  The  ADMP  will  use  Horticultural  Support  Project
/Dairy Value Chains Development Project legal staff. In addition, the Project will count on
the  services  of  national  and  international  specialists  in  various  fields.  A  Project
Implementation Team (PIT, RRA regional representation) will be established in one of the
regions  of  the  Project  area  in  PY1.  The  PIT  would  comprise  a:  Regional  Coordinator
(Value  Chain  and  Business  Specialist),  three  Rural  Finance  Officer/gender/youth,
Engineer,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  (M&E  Specialist)  and  a  driver.  The  PIT  will  be
responsible for day-to-day implementation in the field of all aspects  of the Project, with
the  exception  of  financial  administration  and  procurement,  which  will  be  managed
entirely by the relevant personnel of the RRA/ADMP PMU at central level.
The PMU/PIT  shall  coordinate  the  work  of  consultants  and  participating  financial
14.
institutions (PFIs) that will interact with VC actors on planning and financial matters.
The  MOF  shall  make  the  Subsidiary  Loans  available  to  the  PFIs  under  Subsidiary
15.
Loan  Agreements  (SLAs)  to  be  entered  into  between  the  Borrower/Recipient,  the  RRA
and each PFI. The SLAs shall be under terms and conditions cleared by the Fund and in
adherence  with  the  Investment  Guidelines. Except  as  the  Fund  shall  otherwise  agree,
the MOF shall not assign, amend, abrogate or waive any SLA or any of its provisions. The
project monitoring and evaluation system and processes will be established and managed
in accordance with established IFAD procedures by the PMU with support from IFAD. The
5
Appendix I
EB 2017/122/R.27/Rev.1
Logical Framework provides indicators for implementation along with their corresponding
means of verification. These will form the basis on which the M&E system will be built.
16.
At  the  start  of  the  Project  and  no  later  than  90  days  after  the  date  of  entry  into
force  of  this  Agreement,  the  PMU  shall  manage  a  comprehensive  baseline  survey  which
will  be  updated  on  annual  basis  to  track  the  different  Project  indicators  over  time,
including  for  the  mid-term  review.  During  the  Project’s  final  year,  a  completion  survey
will be conducted. Results will be compared against the baseline survey results to assess
project impact.
17.
Supervision. The  Project  will  be  directly  supervised  by  IFAD.  The  IFAD  country
team shall provide continuous implementation support to the Project and shall undertake
supervision  missions  on  an  annual  basis  to  assess  overall  management  arrangements
and  performance  including  financial  and  procurement  aspects  and  monitoring  and
evaluation. The supervision shall be carried out jointly with the Borrower  representatives
and IFAD.
18.
Mid-Term Review. A mid-term review shall be carried out towards the end of third
Project year. The review shall be undertaken in accordance with IFAD-MTR guidelines in
consultation with the Borrower  representatives.
19.
Project  Implementation  Manual  (PIM). The  RRA/PMU  shall  prepare  a  draft  PIM
acceptable to  the  Fund  and  submit  it  to  the  Fund  for  no  objection.  The  PIM  may  be
amended when necessary with the approval of the Fund in order to introduce clarification
in  procedures,  eliminating  constraints  for  project  implementation  and  for  facilitating
access of producers to the project services.

This indicator is inspired by the RIMS Impact-level indicator “Number of people experiencing economic mobility”, corresponding to SDG target 1.1 and 1.2, but taking into account the specific aspect of income, where ADMP is expected to generate an impact. These
project’s direct beneficiaries are estimated around 75,000 households. These include stakeholders benefitting of credit lines supported by the ADMP, as well as of trainings/other supports provided by the project and by the project’s supported LEs, or from FFS
curricula and guided exposure to technological demonstration plots.
2 RIMS impact level indicator, corresponding to SDG target 1.1 and 1.2.
3 The target corresponding to some 80% of the number of full-time equivalent jobs created through ADMP interventions (see Appendix 10, Economic and Financial Analysis).
4 Uzagroexport is a state enterprise that monitors the export. There is a branch in each region of Fergana Valley.
5 Including, but not limited to, formal contracts with traders / aggregators / processors. LEs will specify those linkages in their Strategic Plans / Roadmaps, developed by LEs within sub-comp. 1.1.
6
The outreach is mostly determined by sub-component 1.2’s interventions. Beneficiaries include 1,200 LE representatives (also benefitting of support under sub-component 1.1 for their roadmap; about 5,000 LE suppliers,
benefitting from inclusive workshops/ trainings; about 600 Mahalla leaders (community mobilization and TOT); about 1,000 additional Mahalla members; 3,200 producers benefitting of demo plots (10 farmers at least for each demo
plot established); 2,250 FFS members. Adoption rate is about 80%.

7 Adapted from the RIMS CI 1.1.4: “Number of persons trained in production practices and/or technologies”.
8 The Rural Guarantee Facility (US$ 9.9m) would allow mobilizing a five-fold amount of loans. With an average loan size of US$ 20,000 (assumed also for other credit lines within ADMP’s scope, this implies some 2,475 loans.
9 ADMP’s funded credit lines (US$ 54.8m) would generate some 1,200 loans with average size of US$ 45,000. The target is expected to be achieved faster than the Rural Guarantee Facility as the credit lines are expected to be
immediately operational.
10 Under the assumption that youth would borrow an average of U$$ 10,000, the Youth Fund (US$ 10.0m) would be able to generate some 1,000 loans, one fourth by mid-term.
11 The modernization of the tertiary irrigation would benefit some 3,500 ha in the three regions, with 3.5 ha average land size / farm it implies some 1,000 households.
