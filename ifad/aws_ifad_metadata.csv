With respect to the sustainable development action plan for aquaculture, this project is aligned with: (i) strengthening support services; (ii) making production systems more efficient; and (iii) professionalizing the subsector.\nThe overall objective of PD-PAC is to bring about a sustainable improvement in income and food security for fishers and fish farmers by developing the fisheries value chain. The specific objective is to sustainably improve fish production to increase the incomes of fishers and fish farmers. The project approach is to strengthen and better structure the value chain to enable small-scale fishers and fish farmers to obtain larger profit margins.\n \nPresident’s report\nProposed loan to the Republic of the Congo for the Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Project\nArabic\n / \nEnglish\n / \nFrench\n / \nSpanish\n"

Since its inception in 2011, PSE has been demonstrated to have great potential to reduce poverty and foster economic growth. The sales from enterprises benefiting from PSE represent approximately 25.7 per cent of Ecuador's GDP, contributing 10 per cent of the total net income and generating close to 60 per cent of total jobs in the country.\nThe Government of Ecuador, through the Instituto de Economía Popular y Solidaria (IEPS), is promoting the PSE throughout the country as a viable and efficient instrument to alleviate poverty, enhance social mobility and ensure redistribution.\nWithin this context, the IFAD-funded Strengthening the Rural Actors of the Popular and Solidarity Economy Project (FAREPS) seeks to improve the conditions for the development of a solidarity economy in the provinces of Guayas and Los Rios in the coastal region; Azuay in the central highlands; and Morona Santiago and Zamora Chinchipe in the Amazon. The project is expected to reach at least 20,000 poor and vulnerable rural families engaged in farming and non-farming activities.\nTo achieve this overarching target, the project will work hand-in-hand with PSE organizations, associations, cooperatives, communes and communities, to strengthen their membership and their institutional and managerial abilities. It aims to build the capacities of these organizations to develop a culturally and environmentally sustainable, market-oriented production model.\nFAREPS will help transform smallholder farmers' visions into viable modern businesses based on trust and cooperation operating in a competitive environment. \n \n \n"

It will mprove food security and nutrition among artisanal inland fishing and fishfarming households while addressing  climate change issues that affect fisheries and aquaculture sectors.\nIt will be implemented in \nBengo, Cuanza Norte, Luanda and Malange\n provinces in Angola's central-north region. \nThe inland artisanal fisheries development will cover communes north of the Cuanza River, between Dondo (Cuanza Norte) and the mouth of the Cuanza River (Luanda); and communes traversed by the Dande and Bengo Rivers, in Bengo and Luanda. Both areas have a large number of lakes, some of which are seasonally or permanently linked to those rivers. All fishing communities are located around the lakes and along the rivers. \nThe project will target an estimated 15,000 people, or about 10,000 fishers and 5,000 processors and small traders.\nIt will support activities that:\nstrengthen institutional capacity (national, provincial, local/extension services)\nimprove community participation in economic and wider local development \nprocesses\nincrease the quantity and quality of fish produced and sold on a sustainable basis\n"

The programme will revitalise the agricultural sector, build small-scale infrastructure and create income opportunities for over 68,000 poor, rural households.\nThe national programme will cover all nine provinces. Specifically, it will support smallholder farmers who produce commodities, such as cocoa and coconut, to partner with agri-businesses to add value to agricultural products and create jobs.  It will also invest in community-managed small-scale infrastructure to provide basic services such as roads, bridges and docks.\nThe financing agreement includes funds specifically designated for disaster recovery assistance.  These will be used to rebuild the Guadalcanal communities that were heavily affected by flash floods in 2014. All infrastructure investments will incorporate measures to mitigate future effects of climate change and natural disaster.\nThe 550,000 people living in the country face huge constraints as they are scattered over 90 islands and far from neighbouring countries.  People are often living in remote areas with limited access to land and limited opportunity to earn a viable income from agriculture.\nRead more\nWomen lead a revived honey industry in the Solomon Islands\n"
