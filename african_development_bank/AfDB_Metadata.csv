The project complements another Bank project under consideration, the Integrated Livestock Value Chain Development Project (PDCVIE) which aims to improve livestock production through the development and integration of meat product value chains. The PDCVIE will cover the same project impact areas as PIMSAR and will build on the ecosystem to increase the productivity and production of the livestock introduced by the latter project for better synergy. PIMSAR will also complement the Emergency Project for Increasing Agricultural Production in Burkina Faso (PURPA-BF) under consideration which aims to contribute to increasing maize, rice, soya bean, cowpea, sorghum and wheat production to strengthen the people’s food security in the face of the impacts of the war in Ukraine. PIMSAR will rely on the production tools already put in place by PURPA (training and organization of actors, support to the seed industry, improvement of production tools, etc.). In addition, the increase in maize and soybean production will contribute to a better coverage of animal feed needs, which remains one of the objectives of PIMSAR. The total project cost during the five-year implementation period, including provisions for price escalation and physical contingencies, net of customs duties and taxes, is estimated at UA 41.59 million or about USD 54.90 million.","https://www.afdb.org/sites/all/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afdb.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2Fprojects-and-operations%2Fburkina_faso_-_integrated_maize_soybean_poultry_and_fish_value_chain_development_and_resilience_building_project_-_project_appraisal_report.pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,-13,848",28000000,Burkina Faso,44911,Approved,African Development Fund,Agriculture and Rural Development,Sovereign

Most  of the  population in  the  agricultural  sector can only access to  the informal financing, which probes not to  be sustainable,  and  much  less  capable  of addressing all the needs of agribusinesses .So far, the technical and financial partners’ interventions to enhance access to finance  remained mainly in  the  form  of  matching grant, which isa one-off  grant,  and  therefore  not  a sustainable source of financing.8.The rationale for the Bank’s involvement in the proposed project rests on its alignment with the current top priority  areas  of  intervention  of both  the Bank  and The Gambia, as outlined  above. The GAMIRSAL Establishment Project would address a number of market failures, including: i) difficulties for actors  along  the agriculture  value  chains  to  access  suitable  financial  services  and  products,  due  to lack of satisfactory collaterals and risk mitigating instruments as well as prohibitive borrowing cost; ii) reluctance  of  FIs  to  finance  agriculture  despite their  high  liquidity, due to  their  lack  of  knowledge  of the agricultural sector, the agriculture perceived and inherent risks including climate risks and the lack of  agriculture  tailor-made  financial  products;  iii)  limited  capacity  of  actors  along  agriculture  value chains to develop bankable business plans and efficiently manage credit and climate change risk. Also, the project fits well into the new policy paradigm for agricultural development promoted by the Bank and the Government, which  aims  at  transforming  agriculture, through the  Gambia  Agriculture Transformation Program.","https://www.afdb.org/sites/all/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afdb.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2Fprojects-and-operations%2Fgambia_-_incentive-based_risk_sharing_system_for_agricultural_lending_gamirsal_establishment_project_-_project_appraisal_report_0.pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,-13,848",5000000,Gambia,44873,Approved,African Development Fund,Agriculture and Rural Development,Sovereign

The project is consistent with the Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Sector Programme and the National Agricultural Investment Programme (PSAEP/PNIAEP 2016-2020), which is also aligned with the General Government Policy (PGE) and the Madagascar Emergence Plan (PEM). This operation stems from the Government’s urgent need to reverse the trend in agricultural sector underperformance in the production and processing of agricultural products, especially in the South-West region, whose development potential contrasts with the recurrent food insecurity in this part of the country. The project focuses on the processing of agricultural products, and thereby contributes to wealth creation through jobs generated in agroindustry, preserves economic and financial stability by reducing imports of agro-food products, and responds to post-COVID-19 impacts. The PTASO will promote agricultural value chains (AVCs) such as rice, cape peas, maize, fishery products and small ruminants, through infrastructure development and the implementation of measures likely to attract the private sector to play its role in key areas of industrial processing and marketing. The main activities financed by the project are: (i) improvement of the regulatory framework to develop SAPZs and strengthen institutions; (ii) construction of basic infrastructure in Tuléar agro-industrial platform and agribusiness centres (Ankilililoake and Tandadave); (iii) improvement of agricultural production infrastructure (irrigated areas, aquaculture farms, etc.) and marketing (storage warehouses, rural roads, etc.); and (iv) capacity building for stakeholders in the agro-industrial sectors (Government services, farmer organisations, etc.). These activities will create wealth and employment, improve food security and reduce chronic malnutrition in this part of the country which, despite its potential, remains a pocket of famine.

The total cost of the project is UA 26 million.",https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/Burkina_Faso_-_Appraisal_Report_-_Bagre_Growth_Pole_Support_Project__PAPCB__%E2%80%93_05_2015.pdf,21000000,Burkina Faso,42123,Implementation,African Development Fund,Agriculture and Rural Development,Sovereign
https://projectsportal.afdb.org/dataportal/VProject/show/P-Z1-AAZ-023,P-Z1-AAZ-023,Multinational - Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS),"In the Sahel, the number of people suffering from chronic food and nutrition insecurity, poverty and vulnerability to the effects of climate change is rising steadily. A lasting solution to food and nutrition insecurity in the Sahel requires building resilience to climate change, long-term agricultural sector financing and developing trade and regional integration. By making sustained longer term investments in household resilience, the cost of emergency assistance will be significantly reduced and, ultimately, the cycle of recurring famine will be broken. This is the most cost-effective intervention option which meets the basic needs and preserves the dignity of the populations of the Sahel. It is within this framework that the Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS) was designed.",https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and-Operations/Multinational-Programme_to_build_resilience_to_food_and_nutrition_insecurity_in_the_Sahel__P2RS__-_11_2014.pdf,22241096.43,Multinational,42079,Completion,African Development Fund,Agriculture and Rural Development,Sovereign
