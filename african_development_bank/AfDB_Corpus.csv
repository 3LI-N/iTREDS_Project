The project complements another Bank project under consideration, the Integrated Livestock Value Chain Development Project (PDCVIE) which aims to improve livestock production through the development and integration of meat product value chains. The PDCVIE will cover the same project impact areas as PIMSAR and will build on the ecosystem to increase the productivity and production of the livestock introduced by the latter project for better synergy. PIMSAR will also complement the Emergency Project for Increasing Agricultural Production in Burkina Faso (PURPA-BF) under consideration which aims to contribute to increasing maize, rice, soya bean, cowpea, sorghum and wheat production to strengthen the people’s food security in the face of the impacts of the war in Ukraine. PIMSAR will rely on the production tools already put in place by PURPA (training and organization of actors, support to the seed industry, improvement of production tools, etc.). In addition, the increase in maize and soybean production will contribute to a better coverage of animal feed needs, which remains one of the objectives of PIMSAR. The total project cost during the five-year implementation period, including provisions for price escalation and physical contingencies, net of customs duties and taxes, is estimated at UA 41.59 million or about USD 54.90 million.","https://www.afdb.org/sites/all/libraries/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afdb.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2Fprojects-and-operations%2Fburkina_faso_-_integrated_maize_soybean_poultry_and_fish_value_chain_development_and_resilience_building_project_-_project_appraisal_report.pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,-13,848"

MNWAP will be implemented over three phases, where the first part of Phase I (MNWAP-1A) was approved for financing by the Bank in December 2021 and the second part of Phase I (MNWAP-1B) reported here. The Program will help reduce the impact of climate change as well as job creation leading to economic development. Phase 1 (part A & B) of the project entails the construction of the Mpakeni Dam (approved in 2021) and the downstream development of 4,600 hectares of cotton that will be processed for a vertically integrated textile industry (raw cotton to garments and oil).

In response to this situation, the Government, acting through the Food Security Commission, developed a National Response Plan 2022 (NRP 2022) which is the annual breakdown of all actions to promote food and nutritional security in the country. In fact, through the PUPSAN project, the Bank will provide financing to strengthen the significant impacts on the resilience of vulnerable populations, with a view to supporting the crop production sector by strengthening productivity gains, through the mastery of climate-resilient techniques, the provision of plant material and other appropriate agricultural inputs. The Bank's support will increase the availability of foodstuff needed to cover the food and nutritional needs of the Malian population, create value added in the project areas, generate substantial additional income for producers and other stakeholders in the targeted sectors, improve the balance of trade and reduce Mali's dependence on imports of these targeted products. The project will also contribute to strengthening the resilience of the population by improving the employability of the youth and women in the targeted sectors.

The project is consistent with the Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Sector Programme and the National Agricultural Investment Programme (PSAEP/PNIAEP 2016-2020), which is also aligned with the General Government Policy (PGE) and the Madagascar Emergence Plan (PEM). This operation stems from the Government’s urgent need to reverse the trend in agricultural sector underperformance in the production and processing of agricultural products, especially in the South-West region, whose development potential contrasts with the recurrent food insecurity in this part of the country. The project focuses on the processing of agricultural products, and thereby contributes to wealth creation through jobs generated in agroindustry, preserves economic and financial stability by reducing imports of agro-food products, and responds to post-COVID-19 impacts. The PTASO will promote agricultural value chains (AVCs) such as rice, cape peas, maize, fishery products and small ruminants, through infrastructure development and the implementation of measures likely to attract the private sector to play its role in key areas of industrial processing and marketing. The main activities financed by the project are: (i) improvement of the regulatory framework to develop SAPZs and strengthen institutions; (ii) construction of basic infrastructure in Tuléar agro-industrial platform and agribusiness centres (Ankilililoake and Tandadave); (iii) improvement of agricultural production infrastructure (irrigated areas, aquaculture farms, etc.) and marketing (storage warehouses, rural roads, etc.); and (iv) capacity building for stakeholders in the agro-industrial sectors (Government services, farmer organisations, etc.).
