The pdf webscraping code of the project documents from the gafsp website https://www.gafspfund.org/ follows the following steps:

1. Using BeautifuSoup under the bs4 library, find all projects listed in https://www.gafspfund.org/ that have a call for proposal of 2015 or later.
2. For each year, use the same method to narrow the search down to the project links
3. Under each project link, get all pdf documents recorded on that page (if intending to save pdfs, open files, write to the files, and save the files with a pdf extension)
4. convert these pdf documents into txt files using the pyPDF2 library modules
