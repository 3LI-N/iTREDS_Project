West Africa Food System Resilience Program (FSRP) ,PIDASAN,P178132,,,,,,Burkina Faso,Active,Public,World Bank,2017,"26,530 million",24 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Multiple shocks across West Africa, largely induced by agricultural risks, have made food scarcer and more expensive and have increased malnutrition. In 2021, approximately 27 million West Africans needed immediate food assistance due to a combination of drought, poverty, high cereal prices, environmental degradation, displacement, poor trade integration, and conflict. Sobering predictions of more-frequent extreme weather events, coupled with agricultural productivity that is not keeping pace with population growth, means long-term sustainable development is under threat.
Solution
FSRP supports the second phase of Burkina Faso’s National Rural Sector Program, targeting 125 communes in nine regions, chosen for their high agricultural potential and relatively favorable climate conditions, impacting an estimated 300,000 poor people, including 120,000 women and 30,000 youth. Increasing agricultural productivity by adopting improved agricultural technologies, such as drought- and pest-resistant seed varieties, composting and erosion-control techniques, and livestock and poultry feeding technologies, will increase feed production and crop yields. Interventions also aim to improve the crops’ and vegetables’ nutritional quality, providing marketing assistance, empowering rural farmers to use various technologies that reduce livestock and feed expenditures while improving the quality of food and dietary intake, and creating jobs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technological Innovation for Agroforestry and Agriculture Program (PITAG),PTTA II,,,,,,,Haiti,Active,Public,IDB,2017,75 million,20 million,agriculture,"Challenge
In Haiti, agriculture contributes about 22% of GDP, accounting for around 50% of overall employment, 66% of employment in rural areas, and 75% of employment in low-income households. Agri-producers typically use outdated and ineffective planting materials and soil conservation and pest management techniques, and hardware is limited to hand tools, resulting in low farm income levels, land degradation, increased vulnerability of farmers to natural hazards, and food insecurity.
Solution
PITAG is building on the accomplishments of the Small Farmer Agriculture Technology Transfer Project (PTTA) and similar programs in Haiti to increase agricultural productivity and improve the use of natural capital through the adoption of sustainable technologies. Notably, the project conducts research to increase sustainability in Haiti’s agricultural sector, including to strengthen agricultural research in rice, coffee and cacao, legumes, and roots and tubers; improve small agricultural mechanization through technology adaptation and transfer; create, improve, or adapt sustainable agricultural technologies to enhance the supply of technology available to farmers; and adopt more-profitable, climate smart, and sustainable agricultural technologies to improve farm profitability, generate positive environmental benefits, and facilitate climate change mitigation and adaptation. Agricultural incentives support interested farmers to participate in a series of fairs that match demand and supply for the various technologies. Women are strongly encouraged to apply for incentives during information and awareness-raising meetings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chain Sector Project in the CDZ (CFAVC),CFAVC,,UTF/MYA/026/MYA,48409-003,,,,Myanmar,Active,Public,"ADB , FAO",2017,80.75 million,38 million,agriculture,"Challenge
The Government of Myanmar recently formulated the Agriculture Policy (Second Short Term Five Year Agriculture Policies and Plans) with its vision statement for the development of the agriculture sector: an inclusive, competitive, food and nutrition secured and sustainable agricultural system contributing to the socio-economic well-being of farmers and rural people and further development of the national economy. It is estimated that at least 37% of the 51.4 million population live under the poverty line. Myanmar’s stunting rate ranks 106 out of the 132 countries surveyed by UNICEF, and it is among the top ten countries most affected by global climate risk. About 70% of the population in Myanmar resides in rural area and agriculture sector being their main economic activities. Agriculture sector contributes 30% of national GDP, however the land based benefits being obtained by the farmers are extremely low. Farmers in the Central Dry Zone (CDZ) face mounting challenges that threaten the production of key crops, such as insufficient rainfall, shortage of labor, increased foreign competition, and a lack of access to quality seed.
Solution
CFAVC is increasing the climate resilience of critical rural infrastructure, enhancing quality and safety testing capacity, strengthening technical and institutional capacity for climate smart agriculture, and creating an enabling policy environment for climate-friendly agribusinesses to promote environmental sustainability. To facilitate production of improved, climate-resilient seed, the project is upgrading irrigation, farm roads, buildings, farm machinery, post-harvest equipment, seed testing equipment, and agro-meteorological stations in 10 Department of Agriculture seed farms. 
The project also promotes climate smart agriculture and agribusiness by deploying climate-resilient varieties of rice, beans, pulses, and oilseeds and strengthening the capacity of seed growers, agro-dealers, and regional government staff on good agricultural practices. The project is establishing an agricultural digital finance service to train agribusinesses on business plan development, efficient manufacturing practices, and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points. The project also improves value addition, food quality and safety, and access to inputs, such as climate-resilient seed varieties, quality agrochemicals, and farm mechanization services, to increase off-farm rural livelihood opportunities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Food and Nutrition Security through Sustainable Agriculture (FANSEP),FANSEP,P164319,,,,,,Nepal,Active,Public,World Bank,2017,60 million,48 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Nepal’s economy is highly dependent on agriculture, accounting for about one-third of GDP and employing two-thirds of the population. In the selected 14 project districts, an estimated 40–60% of the population is unable to meet the minimum daily caloric intake. The sector is characterized by smallholder, traditional, and substance farming; however, farmers typically have limited use of improved livestock, seeds, crop varieties, or modern practices. They also are hindered by poor irrigation systems and high instances of pests and disease, in addition to a high risk of natural disasters, like floods and drought.
Solution
FANSA enhances climate resilience and improves agricultural productivity and nutrition practices in targeted smallholder farming communities. The project primarily targets vulnerable households, namely those that are earthquake affected, acutely food insecure, disadvantaged, marginalized, and headed by women. The project focuses on crops, such as rice, wheat, maize, finger millet, and potato; and highly nutritious crops, such as buckwheat, pulses, beans, and vegetables; and livestock species of poultry, goats, and cows and has introduced and promoted climate-smart and nutrition-sensitive agriculture practices, providing better-performing plant and animal genetic resources and building farmers’ capacities to improve agronomic and animal husbandry practices.  
 
The project also strengthens producer groups representing the targeted smallholder farmers, providing training around commodities of common interest and enhancing skills and capacities in good governance and leadership, group dynamics, decision-making, problem-solving, and risk management. Provided training addresses bookkeeping, meeting organization, agriculture seasonal planning, marketing, value addition, preparation of simple business plans, and simple monitoring and evaluation. Finally, building on experience gained from GAFSP’s Agriculture and Food Security Project on nutrition interventions, FANSA directly works with communities, including female health community volunteers, using a community-driven, skills-based learning approach known as the Nutrition Field School to remove barriers to improved dietary and care practices by supporting a package of inputs and services complemented by a behavioral change campaign for improved use of foods and hygiene and sanitation practices, while increasing access to public health services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sustainable Agricultural Intensification for Improved Livelihoods, Food Security and Nutrition Project (SAIP)",SAIP,P164520,,,,,,Rwanda,Active,Public,"FAO , World Bank",2017,32.97 million ,26.3 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Rwanda’s agriculture sector is steadily growing at 5.8% per year. Currently, it accounts for about 33% of GDP, employs about 68% of the labor force, and generates 90% of national food requirements. Around half of the country is covered by hills, and between them are streams and marshlands with 589,711 hectares of irrigation potential, but only 7.5% has been successfully developed to date. Droughts or short heavy rains often cause flash flooding and low productivity, with most rain-fed agricultural production worsened by the impacts of climate change. To sustain cultivation and productivity on such steep slopes, comprehensive climate smart watershed management has become a necessity, not a choice.
Solution
SAIP strengthens the capacities of existing farmer organizations and public extension services; strengthens agricultural value chains; emphasizes post-harvest handling, processing, and marketing systems and linkages with the private sector; and scales up irrigation activities and increases irrigation outreach, thereby increasing the availability and consumption of nutritional foods, diversifying income generation means, and supporting rural financial institutions to provide services. The project focuses on strengthening value chains, including vegetables and fruits for the domestic, regional, and international markets; maize and Irish potato for domestic and regional markets; and beans for domestic markets. To improve nutrition outcomes, the project collaborates with the Government’s National Early Childhood Development Program and community health workers to implement a nutrition social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) strategy, using cooking demonstrations to educate communities on how to attain a balanced and affordable diet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tanzania Initiative for Preventing Aflatoxin Contamination (TANIPAC),TANIPAC,,,,,,,Tanzania,Active,Public,AfDB,2017,27 million,20 million,agriculture,"Solution
Tanzania is a leading producer of maize and groundnuts in the East African region, accounting for 2% of world production. They are the major staple foods, with maize contributing an estimated 35% of the average daily calorie intake and making up nearly half of dietary requirements. More than half of Tanzanians live in rural areas and depend on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods. However, these crops are highly susceptible to fungal infestation and aflatoxin contamination—the leading cause of liver disease and liver cancer in Tanzania—and reduces the country’s export-earning potential. 
TANIPAC aims to minimize aflatoxin occurrence in the food system, leading to improved food safety and security and ultimately to improved health and nutrition, agricultural productivity, and trade. Through its infrastructure development component, the project will rehabilitate the Ministry of Agriculture’s National Bio-control Unit, establishing a post-harvest center of excellence for grains and a central agriculture reference laboratory for enabling mycotoxin control along the food production and supply chain. The project also carries out public awareness and education on food safety, nutrition, and aflatoxin mitigation. The private sector’s role in monitoring and quality control at all segments of the value chains is important, so the project establishes partnerships with commercial buyers to support advocacy and disseminate new technology on both the mainland and in Zanzibar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inclusion of Rural Youth in Poultry and Aquaculture Value Chains in Mali ,-,,,,2000001761,,,Mali,Active,Public,IFAD,2017,"2,68 million","2,61 million",agriculture,"Solution
Across many parts of the Sahel, conflict and violence has intensified just as drought and rising temperatures are undermining food production and agricultural productivity. Land available to pastoralists, who traditionally roam for pasture, is shrinking, leading to conflict. Within this context, young people are increasingly caught between violence and a lack of opportunity for meaningful employment. To help combat this, the project supports rural youth in creating income-generating activities that foster food and nutrition security. 



            Results 
              
As of December 2021, the project has benefitted 1,135 people, of which 38% are women, across 49 producer-based organizations and has involved producer organizations, local banks and microfinance institutions, and other innovative financing arrangements and service providers. The projecthas    enabled 1,135 smallholder farmers to access funds along with extension services. Further, the project has constructed or rehabilitated 20 post-harvest facilities, improving production on 239.25 hectares of land, and has provided 1,025 smallholders with productivity enhancement support; 1,155 people, including 695 women, with improved nutrition services and products; and 1,050 people with access to direct employment, including 732 youth and 325 women. 
  
Additional funding in 2020 for a medium- to long-term response to the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated a workshop on the banking system and youth agricultural entrepreneurship to support rural youth in improving their entrepreneurial capacity. Additional funds supported the creation of four processing units for poultry and fish in areas of high demand, to promote public-private partnerships. The project also strengthened monitoring systems to collect information on the products of rural youth farms, the quantities marketed, and the income generated to allow youth to understand supply and demand and established contracts with health centers for training, support, and nutritional monitoring of youth and their families to better understand and improve beneficial nutrition habits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strengthening Rural Women’s Livelihood for a Sustainable Economic Development in the Eastern Region of Senegal ,-,,GCP/SEN/069/GAF,,,,,Senegal,Active,Public,FAO,2017,-,"2,48 million",agriculture,"Challenge
This Missing Middle Initiative (MMI) pilot project in Tambacounda and Kedougou regions in east Senegal supports two producer organizations, l’Association des producteurs de la vallée du fleuve Gambie (APROVAG) and Yacare Niani Wulli (YNW), to strengthen rural people’s livelihoods for sustainable economic development. The project will increase governance, production and management capacities of smallholder producers; improve women’s participation and bargaining power in key decision-makings in rural areas; reinforce rural entrepreneurship initiatives initiated by women and the youth; increase commercial contracts between the POs and the private sector that benefits each actor and integrate POs’ economic activities in the food value chain; and strengthened financing capacities of smallholder producers through the POs. 
Solution
Bananas are in great demand in Senegal’s cities and provide an income-generating opportunity for smallholder farmers. But, they require a lot of water to grow, so the drought and dry periods farmers regularly face can seriously stress the plants unless irrigation is readily available. When ample healthy banana crops grow, farmers lack disease-free planting materials to harvest them. This project aims to create more-sustainable banana production, thus boosting incomes and livelihoods, through support to producer organizations. In 2020, the project received additional funding for a medium- to long-term responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, used to procure and distribute inputs to banana producers who had suffered losses caused by the restrictive measures during the peak of the pandemic period in 2020 and to strengthen producer organizations’ management information systems and develop their business models for productive investment to improve producer marketing capacity.



            Results
              
As of December 2021, the project has reached 1,685 people, including 979 women, and members of producer organizations. The members of partner producer organization APROVAG have seen increases in thee productivity of their banana plantations as a result of 7,000 renewed vitro plants in genetic material, distributed among producers with improved organic inputs.

Challenge
The Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu are among the smallest, most-isolated, and most-fragile of Small Islands Developing States. In recent decades, cheap non-nutritious imports, such as rice, noodles, bread, and sugar, have become readily available and slowly replaced traditional crops, which are more difficult to grow and cook. As a result, populations have become more reliant on these imports and traditional diets have changed, leading to severe deterioration in health and nutrition statuses. In particular, the prevalence of nutrition disorders is escalating, with high levels of stunting in children, overweight/obesity in adults, and non-communicable diseases, including hypertension and diabetes.
Solution
Against this backdrop, SIFWaP seeks to improve food, nutrition, and water security and livelihood opportunities in the small island communities by investing in community-, group-, and household-level projects. The project will sensitize communities to diagnose, prioritize, and implement activities that improve agricultural systems and ensure the production and availability of local, nutritious foods; mainstream climate change adaptation measures into agricultural production activities to increase climate resilience; and develop an enabling policy framework to address food, nutrition, and water security.

In Burundi, a $2.34 million aims to support small family farmers who are members of CAPAD cooperatives to be resilient against the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, while sustainably improving their income and food security. The project aims to do so by supporting the quantitative and qualitative increase in the supply of multipurpose bananas and their marketing and developing the capacity building of cooperatives in support of the marketing of products. 
The banana sector was selected for this project because it is the most commercialized agricultural production in volume and value, representing 14 percent of Burundi’s GDP and 38 percent of agricultural GDP, and involving more than 1,300,000 farm households. The development of semi-industrial and industrial processing and the recent strengthening of inter-professional cooperation between the sector’s actors (producers, processors and traders) will stimulate wealth creation along the value chains. The project will target Moso, one of the areas most affected by the pandemic in Burundi, and where socio-economic recovery is slow to take hold. The activities will focus on nine CAPAD cooperatives and their over 4,800 members, including small and medium-sized family farmers bananas producers 52 percent of whom are women, affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will provide market opportunities and income to banana producers, who currently face difficulties in exporting and selling their produce on the local market. It will strengthen the operational capacity of cooperatives in the region to provide better economic and commercial services to their members. The investment in strengthening the resilience of producers is justified by the existence of market opportunities for banana juice and the presence of the banana juice processor (SOCOPA) located in the project area. SOCOPA plans, through additional investments, to double its production capacity by 2022 in certain markets, such as that natural gas and non-gas banana juice, coveted for their nutritional qualities. Negotiations/discussions are also underway with the World Food Programme (WFP) to promote the consumption of these banana juices in school canteens, through WFP’s school feeding program.   
The project will introduce new types of plant material, such as banana plants, multi-purpose varieties, allowing the production of bananas for juice or cooking banana, and varieties producing a fruit rich in vitamin A. To ensure wider dissemination of the new varieties, the project collaborates with private sector partners to multiply the variety in laboratories.  
The interventions of the cooperatives involved will, improve in the governance of the cooperatives and increase the efficiency of the banana sector in a cooperative spirit, favorable to the producers, resulting in smallholder farmers' income increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less than 2% of cultivated areas are irrigated, despite huge potential in surface and run-off water. 
Solution
PASA-Lou/Ma/Kaf works to improve food security, rural incomes, and resilience to climate change among three weather hazard-prone regions with nearly 2 million inhabitants and more than 3 million ruminants. Through access to water and sustainable inputs, land tenure security, and improved soil fertility, the project improves small-scale producers’, women’s, and farmers’ organizations’ access to a wide range of agricultural and livestock infrastructure. These include drip irrigation through boreholes and market gardens, mini-boreholes and wells, lowland development for rice and horticultural farming developed through the sills and anti-salt dams, and constructed or rehabilitated livestock boreholes equipped with drinking troughs. The project also strengthens mechanisms for extension services, supports advisory services in developed sites, supports the creation of jobs for youth, organizes producers (i.e. farmers and breeders), and processes and markets produce."
Agriculture Productivity and Nutrition Improvement Project (APNIP),APNIP,,,,,,,Kyrgyz Republic,Active,Public,World Bank,2012,,38 million,agriculture,"Challenge
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic was an early adopter of land reform. Currently, the country’s agriculture sector is driven by small-scale irrigated agriculture and pasture-based livestock production. Two-thirds of the rural population are employed in the sector, with the average farm size less than 1 hectare and small-scale farmers owning most livestock. The majority of these rural households are dependent on crop and livestock sales for their livelihoods. However, food insecurity is high and fluctuates both seasonally and regionally, particularly among children and women. Most food-insecure households rely on a single income and have small household plot sizes and limited livestock. Adverse climatic conditions mean that irrigated agriculture has a major influence on production, rural household incomes, and, consequently, on food security. 
 
Solution
APNIP increases agricultural productivity and food security among rural households in select areas by rehabilitating irrigation and drainage infrastructure. Project-improved irrigation service delivery at farm level has enabled water users’ associations and farmers to improve water management, providing agricultural advisory services and training for improved irrigated crop production and marketing and on-farm water management. Nutrition interventions have been scaled up, including community-level nutrition awareness programs and information about improved domestic gardening to increase dietary diversity. More than one half of the targeted farm households irrigate less than one hectare of land, and 20% are female-headed households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Expanding Rice Production Project (ERPP),ERPP,,,,,,,Tanzania,Closed,Public,World Bank,2012,,22.9 million,agriculture,"Challenge
In Tanzania, the agricultural sector is a key driver of social and economic development, generating 25% of GDP, 24% of exports, and employing over 75% of the population – particularly in rural areas where poverty and food insecurity are highly concentrated. Smallholder farming is characterized by the use of rudimentary tools like the hand hoe and reliant on traditional rain-fed cropping method and animal husbandry. Food is the principal sub-sector, dominated by smallholder subsistence farmers with 0.2 to 2.0 hectares who utilize 80% of the cultivated arable land to produce both food and cash crops. However, most farmers can only produce one crop a year because of poor irrigation infrastructure and water management.
Solution
ERPP increases rice production and marketing in targeted areas of Morogoro on the Tanzanian mainland and on Zanzibar, leading to improved rural incomes and food security, and contributes to climate change adaptation by supporting improved irrigation and water management systems. To do this, the project carries out activities to ensure sustainable seed systems, improve crop productivity through better irrigation and crop management, employ innovative marketing strategies, efforts to manage the irrigation scheme as a block, facilitate bulk purchase of inputs, and coordinate crop sales through a warehousing program. Further, the project promotes improved water use efficiency in irrigated rice production by supporting the System of Rice Intensification, which can reduce water use by up to 50 percent; supports provisions of marketing infrastructure and strengthening market linkages and information; and trains farmers on paddy post-harvest activities and marketing. Project monitoring systems evaluate the participation of female farmers in the targeted irrigation schemes and ensure that women do not lose access to land when productivity and incomes rise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Smallholder Irrigation and Value Addition Project (SIVAP) ,SIVAP,,,,,,,Malawi,Closed,Public,AfDB,2012,,39.6 million,agriculture,"Challenge
In Malawi, one in two people in rural areas are poor – the vast majority are small-scale food producers – driven by poor performance of the agriculture sector, volatile economic growth, population growth, and limited opportunities in non-farm activities. Agriculture accounts for around 30% of Malawi’s GDP, and provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population. The sector is composed of about two million small-scale food producers who use 6.5 million hectares of cultivable land and around 30,000 commercial estates that hold around 1.2 million hectares of cultivable land. Most small-scale food producers cultivate less than one hectare. Only 2% of Malawi’s cropland is irrigated, and almost all the irrigated land is controlled by commercial estates, which mainly grow cash crops such as tobacco, cotton and coffee.
Solution
The Smallholder Irrigation and Value Addition Project (SIVAP) increases agricultural production and productivity through the intensification of irrigation, crop diversification, value addition, and capacity building for sustainable land and water management and value chain development. The main activity, the intensification of irrigation, involves construction of 11 new irrigation schemes and rehabilitation of 5 existing schemes. It also supports the implementation of programs that address institutional and capacity  constraints through capacity building of local farmers’ organizations, water users’ associations (WUAs), and farmers’ cooperatives on production technologies, nutrition, agribusiness, and environmental management. Farmers will be trained on good farming practices including timing, planting, harvesting techniques to maximize crop potential, and nutrition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Platform for Food Security and Rural Development of the Imbo/Mosso (PNSADR-IM),PNSADR-IM,,,,,,,Burundi,Active,Public,IFAD,2012,,30 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Nearly 70% of Burundians lives on less than US$1 a day, and those living in rural areas are the most-severely affected by poverty and food insecurity. The vast majority of the population works in the farming sector, estimated at more than 95%, and most are small farmers who depend on food crops. Their poverty is largely linked to low agricultural productivity, due in large part to the small size of farms, low soil fertility, limited technological and financial capital assets, lack of access to quality seeds and fertilizers, and a limited technical knowledge of farming best practices.
Solution
To support these farmers and help lift them out of poverty, PNSADR-IM strengthens food security and rural development in Imbo and Moso regions by reinforcing hydro-agricultural infrastructure, such as dams and roads in marshlands and plains; provides access to production areas; and develops and strengthens the rice and milk sectors. The project also supports production diversification and promotes nutrition education, while building stakeholder capacity in agricultural development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FAO classifies The Gambia as a Least Developed, Low Income Food Deficit Country, with 31.7% of the population living in extreme poverty. The agriculture sector provides employment for about three-quarters of the labor force, and smallholder farmers supply about 90% of domestically produced food. However, the sector produces low and unpredictable yields, is highly susceptibility to droughts and erratic climate patterns, and is essentially rain fed, with only 3% of the arable land estimated to be under irrigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multisectoral Food Security and Nutrition Project (UMFSNP),UMFSNP,,,,,,,Uganda,Active,Public,World Bank,2013,,27.6 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Subsistence farming by Uganda’s smallholders currently accounts for 96% of all farm production and a quarter of total GDP. The sector employs more than two-thirds of workers, contributing to 40% of household income. At the same time, stunting affects one in three children—more than 2.1 million children across the country, higher than its immediate neighbors—some of whom have lower per capita income. Undernutrition disproportionately affects rural areas, where stunting rates top 36%, compared to 19% in urban areas, and annual costs associated with child undernutrition are estimated at 5.6% of GDP. Meanwhile, Ugandan agricultural policy has focused primarily on increasing productivity and commercialization of staple foods and cash crops to raise farmer incomes. 
Solution
UMFSNP increases the production and consumption of micronutrient rich foods, including African indigenous vegetables, high-iron beans, and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, while increasing the use of community-based nutrition services in smallholder households in project areas. The focus is on promoting short-term changes in high-impact nutrition behaviors and practices that are known to contribute to the medium- and long-term reduction of stunted growth in young children. Activities include distributing start-up materials to increase household production of nutritious foods while improving nutrition and health education through schools and community-based agriculture extension and health services. Services include routinely distributing nutrition commodities, such as iron-folic acid supplements or anthropometric measurement scales, to communities in 15 project districts. The project also supports community-led school demonstration gardens, education for women’s groups, and scaling up of micronutrient supplementation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Mali, a landlocked Sahel country vulnerable to weather conditions, 77% of the population live in rural areas, and 46% are below 15 years old. The economy is largely based on agriculture –around 40% of GDP– sustained mainly by the subsistence farming and livestock sub-sectors, as well as the building and trade sub-sectors. Poverty remains an essentially rural phenomenon, and 22% of the population lived in extreme poverty in 2010, with farmers being the poorest. Overall, these people are unable to meet basic nutritional needs, with undernourishment affecting 4% of the population.
Solution
PReSAN-KL sustainably increases rice and vegetable crop production and productivity while improving incomes through water management and agricultural product development. The project focuses on increased agricultural output, infrastructure for drinking water, improved health and education, and improved capacity of local communities and authorities, professional organizations, and technical service providers. Capacity development strengthens women’s and young people’s participation and organization skills. A nutrition component helps prevent malnutrition and promote health and nutrition by preventing the resurgence of waterborne diseases; increasing and diversifying agricultural production; establishing women’s groups of culinary demonstrations; constructing, rehabilitating, and equipping health centers; improving dispensaries; and producing fortified foods and supplements made from local products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project (PAPSA),PAPSA,,,,,,,Burkina Faso,Closed,Public,World Bank,2013,,37.1 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Burkina Faso has been faced with some major challenges over the years that have threatened food security in the country, from a severe drought in 2011 to an influx of Malian refugees in 2012. As a Sahelian country with 86% of its population employed in the agricultural sector, Burkina Faso is vulnerable to climate shocks, which lead to poor harvests yields, a challenging food production system, and a poor rural population, in addition to the pastoralist lifestyle that promotes competition and may lead to conflict.
Solution
PAPSA supported the government’s National Rural Sector Program by helping poor farmers increase their crop and livestock production and by expanding the volume of food products sold in rural markets. This includes activities such as improving crop production infrastructure through an additional 3,000 hectares of lowland development, 2,000 hectares of small-scale irrigation, and 800 kilometers of corridors to facilitate animal access to water resources and supporting an additional 5,000 hectares of soil conservation and 3,000 compost pits for soil restoration. The project engaged in a variety of activities to develop animal production facilities, including constructing 5,000 fattening units for cattle and sheep, improving vaccine dissemination, building farmer capacity on artificial insemination techniques for cattle, and improving milk collection and processing efforts.

Sustainable Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project (SAPIP),SAPIP,,,,,,,Timor-Leste,Active,Public,World Bank,2013,,21 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Timor Leste’s agriculture sector sustains the livelihoods of 64% of the country’s labor force, but contributes to only around 10% of the economy. The unemployment rate is around 70%, while more than half of the population is under 25 years of age . Malnutrition and food insecurity are particularly pervasive in remote rural areas, often only accessible by horse or foot, and nearly all households exhaust their home-grown food supplies within nine months. These areas typically have rain-fed crop land used for unsustainable small-scale subsistence farming and large areas on steep slopes with infertile soils and are particularly vulnerable to weather shocks, like floods and off-season rains. 
Solution
SAPIP aims to improve incomes, food security, and nutrition in select areas of Timor Leste by improving country-led public sector investments to increase smallholder agricultural productivity. It also empowers farmers and links them to markets, strengthening adaptive research and extension institutions, reducing risk and vulnerability, improving rural non-farm livelihoods, and strategically deploying technical assistance. Further, the project supports municipal and watershed agriculture development planning, farm development initiatives, small-scale infrastructure and farm equipment, and the Ministry of Agriculture’s planning, financing, monitoring, and coordination functions. 
Activities focus on improved watershed management to enhance livelihoods and reduce climate-related vulnerability by improving water management and supporting commercial forestry for environmental rehabilitation. Farmer groups, associations, and cooperatives better engage women and young people. As SAPIP introduces new technologies, it plans to roll out training using the Farmer Field School model, spreading knowledge and skills on agriculture best practices and demonstrating the benefits and cost savings associated with working as a group. Additionally, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is supporting the government to strengthen its monitoring and evaluation functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than half of Hondurans live below the national poverty line of US$2.30 a day, with 46% living in in extreme poverty below US$1.81 a day. About half of the population is rural and accounts for 70% of the country’s poverty. Seventy two percent of agricultural families are dedicated to subsistence agriculture on small plots of land and the agriculture sector generates 38% of all employment and the majority of rural employment, yet the country is highly dependent on imports for its food needs. It is estimated that one in four children are undernourished and stunted. Agriculture productivity is low and vulnerable to external risks. And, Honduras has consistently been identified as one of the countries most affected by climate change, with more than 60 instances of extreme weather events over the past two decades. 
 
Solution
ACS-PROSASUR enhances the food and nutrition security of vulnerable households in select geographical locations in the Corredor Seco (dry corridor) of Honduras’s western and southern areas, where rural poverty is concentrated. The project increases household availability of quality food and incomes of poor rural residents as a basis for improving nutrition and reducing child stunting. The project also supports community child health and nutrition by focusing on access to diverse and quality foods, improved nutrition-related behavior, child growth monitoring, and improved hygiene at the household level. Activities include designing financially viable business plans and incremental food security plans to support small-scale rural producer organizations and small enterprises. This includes carrying out technical assistance, training, and extension services to increase food and agricultural production; introducing high-value crops, processing, and post-harvest processes; and expanding non-farm revenue generation and market links through on- and off-farm jobs. Investments to ensure food security for production of high-value crops are based on climate-smart initiatives intended to promote sustainability and adaptation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small-Scale Irrigation and Value Addition Project (SIVAP),SIVAP,,,,,,,Kenya,Active,Public,"AfDB , FAO",2013,,24 million,agriculture,"Challenge
Agriculture is fundamental to Kenya’s overall economic growth. About 80% of the population lives in rural areas and derives its livelihoods largely from agriculture. Smallholder agriculture dominates the sector contributing 75% of the crops and livestock production. Farmers typically do not have access to agricultural inputs, like high-quality seeds, and have limited access to improved technology and markets. Kenya’s agriculture is largely rain fed, and often the quantity and reliability of rainfall has not been adequate to sustain crop production, leading to pervasive food insecurity. An estimated half of the population lacks year-round access to adequate food, and one in four children is estimated to suffer from stunted growth and chronic undernutrition.
Solution
SIVAP increases incomes, food security, and nutrition along the agriculture value chain by raising agricultural productivity and improving agricultural market access for poor and marginalized communities in 11 counties in arid and semi-arid regions. The project intends to increase the productivity of traditional high-value crops and small livestock by constructing new and rehabilitating existing irrigation schemes. The project also supports post-harvest processing and value addition by promoting agro-processing businesses and improved storage, access to finance and credit through local farmers’ organizations, and youth groups and registered women’s groups. Constructing rural roads and market outlets will strengthen market linkages between farmers, processors, rural and urban consumers, and export markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
